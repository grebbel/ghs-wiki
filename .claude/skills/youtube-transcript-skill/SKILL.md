description: Fetch a YouTube video's metadata and transcript via Playwright and save it as a Markdown file with a YAML front-matter header. Trigger on any request involving a YouTube URL where the user wants the spoken content as text — "get the transcript", "transcribe this video", "summarize this video" (fetch first, summarize after), or any time captions/subtitles are useful.

# youtube-transcript

Drives a real Chromium browser with Playwright to extract a YouTube video's metadata and auto-generated transcript. Works by riding YouTube's own engagement-panel loader instead of hitting the `timedtext` endpoint or the `youtubei/v1/get_transcript` RPC directly — the page's session already has the PoT tokens YouTube now requires, so the data falls out of the DOM.

Output is a Markdown file with a YAML header (all metadata) and a body with chapters interleaved as section headings around the transcript segments.

## When to use

- User shares a YouTube URL and asks for the transcript, captions, or subtitles
- User wants a written record of a talk, podcast, lecture, or interview
- User asks to summarize, quote from, or analyze the spoken content of a video — fetch the transcript first, *then* do the analysis

## Setup (one time)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

## How to invoke

Two output modes:

**Markdown (default) — for "give me the transcript" requests:**

```bash
python fetch_transcript.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" -o transcript.md
```

**JSON — when the user wants a *clean* transcript and you'll polish it yourself:**

```bash
python fetch_transcript.py "URL" --json > /tmp/raw.json
```

Then read the JSON, fix ASR errors (proper nouns, product names, mistranscribed acronyms, obvious stutters), and write the polished `.md` yourself. This is almost always what you want — auto-captions are noisy and the model does this cleanup well in one pass.

Other flags: `--headed` (show the browser, useful for debugging consent/sign-in walls), `--timeout MS` (per-step, default 30s).

## Metadata fields

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title`, `video_id`, `url` | `videoDetails` | Canonical |
| `channel`, `channel_id`, `channel_url` | `videoDetails.author` / `.channelId` | URL is constructed |
| `publish_date` | `microformat.publishDate` | When YouTube made it visible |
| `upload_date` | `microformat.uploadDate` | When the file was uploaded — usually same as publish but differs for premieres / re-uploads |
| `category` | `microformat.category` | E.g. "Science & Technology", "Music" |
| `duration` / `length_seconds` | `videoDetails.lengthSeconds` | `duration` is a `mm:ss` / `h:mm:ss` string |
| `view_count` | `videoDetails.viewCount` | Precise integer (not the rounded "12K" displayed) |
| `default_language` | `microformat.defaultLanguage` / `defaultAudioLanguage` | Often null — many videos don't set it |
| `is_live`, `is_upcoming`, `is_private`, `is_family_safe` | flags | |
| `thumbnail` | `videoDetails.thumbnail.thumbnails[-1].url` | Highest-resolution single URL |
| `thumbnails` | `videoDetails.thumbnail.thumbnails` | All resolutions (default → maxresdefault), each with width/height |
| `keywords` | `videoDetails.keywords` | Creator-set tags, not always populated |
| `caption_tracks` | `captions.playerCaptionsTracklistRenderer.captionTracks` | Each: `language_code`, `name`, `kind` (`'asr'` for auto-generated, `'manual'` for creator-uploaded), `is_translatable` |
| `available_countries` | `microformat.availableCountries` | ISO country codes; long list — usually omitted from the YAML if empty |
| `chapters` | engagementPanels macroMarkersListRenderer | Each: `title`, `start` (label), `start_ms` |
| `description` | `videoDetails.shortDescription` | The **full** creator-written description (see note below) |

### A note on `description` vs `shortDescription`

- `<meta property="og:description">` returns a truncated ~160-char blurb meant for social-share previews
- `videoDetails.shortDescription` is misleadingly named — it's the **full** creator-written description with all line breaks, links, hashtags, and timestamps preserved
- The DOM element `#description-inline-expander` renders the same content as `shortDescription` but with elements made interactive

This skill uses `shortDescription` and exposes it as `description` in the YAML, with a `|` literal block scalar so multi-line text round-trips cleanly.

### Chapters in the body

When YouTube provides chapters, the script emits each chapter as a `## [mm:ss] Title` heading and groups the transcript segments under it. When there are no chapters, the body is a flat `## Transcript` section.

## Workflow recommendation

1. Run with `--json` to get structured data (metadata + raw segments with timestamps).
2. Read the JSON.
3. ASR-clean the transcript (fix product/people names, drop obvious stutters, light punctuation), preserve timestamps.
4. Build the YAML header from the metadata block as-is and write the final `.md`. The script's own `--md` output is fine as a fallback if you don't need cleaning.

## Failure modes

- **`error: "no transcript section"`** — Video has no captions (common for music videos, very short clips, some unlisted videos). The skill still writes the markdown file with metadata only and a placeholder `## Transcript` section. Exit code is `1` so callers can branch on transcript availability without losing metadata.
- **`error: "transcript panel did not render"`** — Trigger fired but the segment renderers didn't appear in time. Bump `--timeout` to 60000 and retry. If it still fails the video may be region-locked, age-gated, or hitting a panel-render path the skill doesn't handle yet — observed on some long-format talks (≥20 min) even when captions exist; see [GH #2](https://github.com/businessdatasolutions/ai-wiki/issues/2). The skill still writes a metadata-only file.
- **Consent or sign-in wall** — Pass `--headed` once, click through manually. For long-term reuse, `BrowserContext.storage_state(path="state.json")` and reload it on subsequent runs.
- **Trusted Types CSP rejection (fixed 2026-05-09, [GH #2](https://github.com/businessdatasolutions/ai-wiki/issues/2))** — YouTube ships a strict CSP that rejects string-form JS evaluation in `wait_for_function` / `evaluate`. The skill registers `bypass_csp=True` on the browser context **and** injects a default Trusted Types policy via `page.add_init_script(...)` (defense in depth). If string-evaluation errors return, verify both are still in place.
- **YouTube DOM drift** — The skill no longer relies on a stable engagement-panel `target-id`; it queries `ytd-transcript-segment-renderer` elements directly anywhere on the page (also fixed in [GH #2](https://github.com/businessdatasolutions/ai-wiki/issues/2)). Metadata is read with optional chaining throughout, so partial drift just nulls a field instead of crashing. If `ytd-transcript-segment-renderer` itself ever gets renamed, the `innerText` fallback on the first expanded engagement panel still works.

## Why not a simpler library?

`youtube-transcript-api` and `yt-dlp` both fetch the `timedtext` endpoint directly. Since 2024, YouTube has been gating that endpoint behind a Proof-of-Origin token tied to a real browser session — so those libraries work intermittently and fail silently (empty 200 responses) on a growing share of videos. Driving a real Chromium with Playwright inherits the session automatically and is the most reliable approach for a "just works" tool inside an agent.

## Why not BeautifulSoup?

Everything useful on a YouTube watch page is JS-rendered, so you have to wait for hydration anyway, and once you've waited, `page.evaluate()` reads from the live DOM more directly than handing HTML to bs4. If you specifically want bs4 in the loop, `await page.content()` gives you the post-hydration HTML string to parse — but for this skill it adds complexity without a payoff.
