  Andrej Karpathy (co-founder of OpenAI, former head of AI at Tesla, and now founder of Eureka Labs) talks with Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan at AI Ascent 2026 about what's changed in the year since he coined "vibe coding." He explains why he's never felt more behind as a programmer, why agentic engineering is the more serious discipline taking shape on top of vibe coding, and why we should think of LLMs not as animals but as ghosts: jagged, statistical, summoned entities that require a new kind of taste and judgment to direct. He also touches on Software 3.0, the limits of verifiability, and why you can outsource your thinking but never your understanding.

Introduction
0:02
We're so excited for our very first
0:03
special guest. He has helped build
0:06
modern AI, then explain modern AI, and
0:10
then occasionally rename modern AI. He
0:14
actually helped co-ound open AAI right
0:16
inside of this office. Was the one who
0:18
actually got Autopilot working at Tesla
0:21
back in the day, and he has a rare gift
0:23
of making the most complex technical
0:26
shifts feel both accessible and
0:28
inevitable.
0:30
You all know him for having coined the
0:31
term vibe coding last year, but just in
0:35
the last few months, he said something
0:36
even more startling. That he's never
0:38
felt more behind as a programmer. That's
0:41
where we're starting today. Thank you,
0:43
Andre, for joining us.
Feeling Behind as a Coder
0:44
Yeah. Hello. Excited to be here and to
0:46
kick us off.
0:47
Okay. So, just a couple months ago, you
0:49
said that you've never felt more behind
0:51
as a programmer. That's startling to
0:53
hear from you of all people. Um, can you
0:55
help us unpack that? Was that feeling
0:57
exhilarating or unsettling?
1:00
Uh yeah, a mixture of both for sure. Uh
1:02
well, first of all, um
1:05
I guess like as many of you, I've been
1:06
using agentic tools like lot code,
1:08
adjacent things, uh for a while, maybe
1:10
over the last year as it came out and it
1:12
was very good at you know chunks of code
1:13
and sometimes it would mess up and you
1:15
have to edit them and it was kind of
1:16
helpful and then I would say December
1:18
was this uh clear point where for me I
1:21
was on a break so I had a bit more time.
1:22
I think many other people were similar
1:24
and uh I just started to notice that
1:26
with the latest models uh the chunks
1:28
just came out fine and then I kept
1:30
asking for more and it just came out
1:31
fine and then I can't remember the last
1:32
time I corrected it and then I was I
1:34
just you know trusted the system more
1:36
and more and then I was vibe coding
1:38
[laughter]
1:39
and uh so it was kind of a I do think
1:42
that it was a very stark transition. I
1:43
think that a lot of people actually I
1:45
tried to I tried to stress this on uh
1:47
Twitter and or X because I think a lot
1:49
of people experienced AI last year as
1:52
ChachiPT adjacent thing. Uh but you
1:54
really had to look again and you had to
1:55
look as of December uh because things
1:58
have changed fundamentally and uh
1:59
especially on this like agentic coherent
2:01
workflow uh that really started to
2:04
actually work. Um, and so I would say
2:07
that um, yeah, it was just that
2:09
realization that really uh, uh, had me
2:12
um, go down their whole rabbit hole of
2:14
just, you know, infinity side projects.
2:16
Uh, my side projects folder is like
2:18
extremely full with lots of random
2:19
things and, uh, just, uh, V coding all
2:21
the time. Uh, so, uh, yeah, that kind of
2:23
happened in December, I would say, and I
2:25
was looking at the repercussions of that
2:26
since.
Software 3.0 Explained
2:28
Um, you've talked a lot about this idea
2:30
of LLMs as a new computer. um that it
2:33
isn't just better software, it's a whole
2:35
new computing paradigm. And um software
2:38
1.0 was explicit rules, software 2.0 was
2:41
learned weights, software 3.0 is this.
2:43
Um if that's actually true, what does a
2:46
team build differently the day they
2:48
actually believe this,
2:50
right? So uh yeah, exactly. So software
2:53
1.0, I'm writing code, software 2.0, I'm
2:56
actually programming by creating data
2:57
sets and training uh training neural
2:59
networks. So the programming is kind of
3:01
like arranging data sets and maybe some
3:02
objectives and neural network
3:03
architectures. And then what happened is
3:05
that basically if you train one of these
3:07
GPT models or LLMs on a sufficiently
3:09
large set of tasks implicit basically um
3:12
implicitly because by training on the
3:14
internet you have to multitask all the
3:15
things that are in the data set. Uh
3:17
these actually become kind of like a
3:18
programmable computer in a certain
3:20
sense. So software 3.0 know is kind of
3:21
about uh you know your programming now
3:24
turns to prompting and what's in the
3:25
context window is your lever over the
3:28
interpreter that is the LLM that is kind
3:30
of like interpreting your context and uh
3:32
performing computation in the dig
3:34
digital information space. So I guess um
3:37
yeah that's kind of the transition and I
3:39
think there's a few examples of that
3:41
really drove it home for me and maybe
3:42
that might be instructive. Uh so for
Agents as the Installer
3:44
example when you when openclaw came out
3:48
when you want to install openclaw you
3:49
would expect that normally this is a
3:50
bash bash script like a shell script. So
3:52
run the shell script to run to install
3:54
open claw. Um but the thing is that in
3:57
order to target lots of different
3:58
platforms and lots of different types of
4:00
computers you might run an open claw.
4:01
This these shell scripts usually balloon
4:03
up and become extremely complex. But the
4:05
thing is you're still stuck in a
4:06
software 1.0 universe of wanting to
4:07
write the code. And actually the open
4:09
claw installation is a is a copy paste
4:12
of a b bunch of text that you're
4:13
supposed to give to your agent. Uh so
4:15
basically it's it's a little skill of uh
4:18
you know copy paste this and give it to
4:19
your agent and it will install open
4:20
claw. And the reason this is a lot more
4:22
powerful is you're working now in the
4:23
software 3.0 paradigm where you don't
4:25
have to precisely spell out you know all
4:27
the individual details of that setup.
4:29
The agent has its own intelligence that
4:30
it packages up and then it kind of like
4:32
follows the instructions and it looks at
4:34
your environment, your computer and it
4:36
kind of like performs intelligent
4:37
actions to make things work and it
4:38
debugs things in the loop and it's just
4:40
like so much more powerful, right? So I
4:42
think that's a very different kind of
4:44
like way of thinking about it is just
4:46
like what is the piece of text to copy
4:47
paste to your agent? That's the
4:48
programming paradigm. Now I think one
Menu Gen vs Raw Prompts
4:50
more maybe uh example that comes to mind
4:52
that is even more extreme than that is
4:54
when I was building um menu genen. So,
4:56
menu genen is this idea where you um you
5:00
come to a restaurant, they give you a
5:01
menu. There's no pictures usually. So, I
5:03
don't know what any of these things are
5:05
uh usually like 30% of the things I have
5:07
no idea what they are, 50%. So, I wanted
5:09
to take a photo of the restaurant menu
5:12
and to get pictures of what those things
5:13
might look like in a generic sense. And
5:16
so I built I've vcoded this app that
5:18
basically lets you upload a photo and it
5:20
does all this stuff and it runs on
5:21
Verscell and uh it basically rerenders
5:24
the menu and it gives you like all the
5:26
items and it gives you a picture that it
5:28
uses an image um you know generator uh
5:31
for to basically OCR all the different
5:33
titles uh use the image generator to get
5:35
pictures of them and then shows it to
5:37
you. And then I saw the software 3.0
5:39
version of this which is which blew my
5:41
mind which is literally just take your
5:43
photo give it to Gemini and say use
5:46
Nanobanana to overlay the the things
5:48
onto the menu. Uh and Nanabanana
5:51
basically returned an image that is
5:52
exactly the picture of the menu that I
5:54
took but it actually put into the pixels
5:56
it rendered the different things in the
5:58
menu and this blew my mind because
6:02
actually all of my menu gen is spirious.
6:04
It's working in the old paradigm that
6:06
app shouldn't exist. uh and uh yeah the
6:09
software 3.0 paradigm is a lot more kind
6:11
of raw. It just um your neural network
6:14
is doing more and more of the work and
6:15
your prompt or context is just the image
6:18
and the output is an image and there's
6:19
no need to have any of the app in
6:21
between. Um so I think that people have
6:24
to kind of like reframe you know not to
6:27
work in existing paradigm of what things
6:30
existed and just think about it as a
6:31
speed up of what exists. It's actually
6:33
like new things are available now. And
6:36
going back to your programming question,
6:37
it's not even I think that's also an
6:38
example of working in the in the old
6:40
mindset because it's not just about
6:41
programming and programming becoming
6:42
faster. This is more general information
6:44
processing that is automatable now. So
6:47
um it's not just even about code. So
6:49
previous code worked over kind of like
6:51
structured data, right? And uh you write
6:53
code over structured data. But like for
6:55
example with my LLM knowledge basis
6:56
project um basically you get LLMs to
6:59
create wikis for your organization or
7:01
for you in person etc. This is not even
7:03
a program. This is not something that
7:04
could exist before because there was no
7:06
there was no code that would create a
7:08
knowledge base based on a bunch of
7:09
facts. But now you can just take these
7:10
documents and uh basically uh recompile
7:14
them in a different way and uh reorder
7:15
them and create something that is uh new
7:17
and interesting uh as a reframing of the
7:19
data. And so these are new things that
7:22
weren't possible. Uh and so I think this
7:24
is uh something that I keep trying to
7:26
get back to as to not only what can we
7:29
do that existed that is faster now but I
7:31
think there's new opportunities of just
7:33
things that couldn't be possible before
7:35
and I almost think that that's more
7:36
exciting.
What’s Obvious by 2026
7:37
I love the menu genen progression and
7:40
dichotomy that you laid out and I think
7:41
even I'm sure many folks here followed
7:43
your own progression of programming from
7:45
last October to early January February
7:48
this year. Um, if you extrapolate that
7:51
further, what is the 2026 equivalent um,
7:54
for building websites in the '9s,
7:56
building mobile apps in the 2010s,
7:59
building SAS um, in the last cloud era,
8:02
what will look completely obvious in
8:04
hindsight that is still mostly unbuilt
8:06
today?
8:08
Um, [clears throat] well, going with the
8:10
example of menu, I guess, uh, so a lot
8:12
of this code shouldn't exist and it's
8:13
just neural network doing most of the
8:15
work. Um I do think that the
8:17
extrapolation looks very weird because
8:19
you could basically imagine
8:21
I don't I yeah so you could imagine
8:23
completely neural computers in a certain
8:25
sense you feed raw videos like imagine a
8:28
device you takes raw videos or audio
8:30
into basically what's a neural net and
8:32
uh uses diffusion to render a UI that is
8:35
kind of like you know unique for that
8:37
moment in a certain sense and um I kind
8:40
of feel like in the early days of
8:42
computing actually people were a little
8:43
bit confused as to whether computers
8:45
would look like calculators or computers
8:46
would look like neural nets and in 50s
8:48
and 60s it was not really obvious which
8:50
way would go and of course we went down
8:52
the calculator path and ended up
8:53
building classical computing and then
8:55
neural nets are currently running
8:56
virtualized on existing computers but
8:58
you could imagine I think that uh a lot
9:00
of this will flip and that the neural
9:01
net becomes kind of like the host
9:02
process and uh the CPUs become kind of
9:05
like the co-processor so we saw the
9:07
diagram of you know intelligence compute
9:09
is going to of neural networks is going
9:10
to take over and become the dominant
9:12
spend of flops so you could imagine
9:14
something really weird and foreign when
9:17
where neural nets are doing most of the
9:18
heavy lifting. They're using tool use as
9:20
this like you know um historical
9:22
appendage for some kinds of like
9:24
deterministic tasks. Uh but what's
9:25
really running the show is these uh
9:27
neural nets that are in a certain way.
9:29
Um so you can imagine something
9:31
extremely foreign as the extrapolation
9:33
but I think we're going to probably get
9:34
there uh sort of piece by piece. Um and
9:36
I don't yeah that that progression is
9:39
TBD I would say.
9:40
[snorts]
Verifiability and Jagged Skills
9:41
I'd like to talk a little bit about um
9:43
uh this concept of verifiability, the
9:45
fact that AI will automate faster and
9:47
more easily domains where the output can
9:49
be verified. Um if that framework is
9:52
right, what work is about to move much
9:54
faster than people realize and what
9:56
professions do we have that people
9:58
actually think are safe but that are
10:00
actually highly verifiable?
10:02
Uh yes. So I I spent uh some time
10:05
writing about verifiability and um
10:07
basically like traditional computers can
10:09
easily automate what you can specify in
10:12
code and uh kind of this latest round of
10:14
LLMs can easily automate what you can uh
10:16
verify in a certain in a certain sense
10:19
because the way this works is that when
10:20
frontier labs are training these LLMs
10:22
these are giant reinforcement learning
10:24
environments. So they are given
10:25
verification rewards and then because of
10:28
the way that these models are trained
10:29
they end up basically uh progressing and
10:32
creating these like jagged entities that
10:34
really peak in capability in kind of
10:36
like verifiable domains like math and
10:37
code and adjacent and kind of like
10:39
stagnate and are a little bit um you
10:41
know rough around the edges when uh
10:43
things are not kind of like in that in
10:44
that space. So I think the reason I
10:46
wrote about verifiability is I'm trying
10:47
to understand why these things are so
10:49
jagged. Um and some of it has to do with
10:52
how the labs train the models but I
10:54
think some of it also has to do with um
10:55
the focus of the labs and what they
10:57
happen to put into the data
10:58
distribution. Uh because some things
11:00
basically are significantly more
11:01
valuable in economy and end up creating
11:03
more environments because the labs
11:05
wanted to work in those settings. So I
11:06
think code is a good example of that.
11:08
There's probably lots of verifiable
11:09
environments they could think about that
11:10
happen not to make it into the mix
11:12
because they're just not that useful to
11:13
have the capability around. Um, but I
11:15
think to me the big um I guess like the
11:18
big mystery is uh the favorite example
11:21
for a while was that how many letters
11:22
are are in a strawberry and the models
11:24
would famously get this wrong and it's
11:26
an example of jaggedness. Uh the models
11:27
now patch this I think but the new one
11:29
is I want to go to a car wash to wash my
11:32
car and it's 50 meters away. Should I
11:34
drive or should I walk? And
11:36
state-of-the-art models today will tell
11:38
you to walk because it's so close. How
11:40
is it possible that state-of-the-art
11:42
Opus 4.7 will simultaneously refactor a
11:46
100,000 like [laughter] codebase line
11:48
codebase or find zero day
11:50
vulnerabilities and yet tells me to walk
11:52
to this car wash? This is insane. And to
11:56
whatever extent these uh models are
11:58
remain jagged, it's an indication that
12:01
number one maybe something's slightly
12:02
off or um number two you need to
12:05
actually be in the loop a little bit and
12:07
you need to treat them as tools and you
12:09
do have to kind of stay in touch with
12:11
what they're doing. And so I think all
12:12
of my writing long story short about
12:14
verifiability is just trying to
12:16
understand um why these things are
12:18
jacked. Is there any pattern to it? And
12:20
I think it's some kind of a combination
12:22
of verifiable plus labs care. Maybe one
12:25
more anecdote that is instructive is uh
12:28
from GPT 3.5 to GPT4 people noticed that
12:31
chess improved a lot and I think a lot
12:33
of people thought oh well it's just a
12:34
progression of the capabilities but
12:36
actually it's it's more that uh I think
12:38
this is public information I think I saw
12:39
it on the internet um a huge amount of
12:41
like um data of chess made it into the
12:43
pre-training set and just because it's
12:46
in a data distribution uh basically the
12:48
model improved a lot more than it would
12:50
just by default. So someone at OpenAI
12:53
decided to add this data and now you
12:55
have a capability that just peaked a lot
12:56
more. And so that's why I think I'm
12:58
stressing this um dimension of it as we
13:01
are slightly at the mercy of whatever
13:03
the labs are doing, whatever they happen
13:04
to put into the mix. And you have to
13:06
actually explore this thing that they
13:08
give you that has no manual. And it
13:10
works in certain settings, but maybe not
13:11
in some settings. And you have to kind
13:13
of um explore it a little bit. And uh if
13:16
you're in the circuits that were part of
13:17
the RL, you fly. And if you're in the
13:19
circuits that are out of the data
13:21
distribution, uh you're going to
13:22
struggle and you have to kind of figure
13:24
out which which circuits you're in in
13:26
your application. And if you and if
13:28
you're not in the circuits, then you
13:29
have to really look at fine-tuning and
13:30
doing some of your own work because it's
13:32
not going to necessarily come out of the
13:34
LLM out of the box.
13:36
I'd love to come back to the concept of
13:38
jagged intelligence in a little bit. Um,
Founder Advice and Automation
13:40
if you are a founder today and thinking
13:42
about building a company, you are trying
13:44
to solve a problem that you think is
13:46
tractable, something that uh is a domain
13:49
that is verifiable, but you look around
13:51
and you think, "Oh my gosh, well, the
13:53
labs have really really started uh
13:56
getting to escape velocity in the ones
13:58
that seem most obvious, math, coding,
14:00
and others." What would your advice be
14:02
to to the founders in the audience?
14:05
Um
14:08
so I think maybe that comes to the
14:10
previous question of I do think that
14:12
verifiability because it um let me
14:14
think. So verifiability makes something
14:17
tractable in the current paradigm
14:18
because you can throw a huge amount of
14:20
RL at it. Um so maybe one way to see it
14:24
is that uh that remains true even if the
14:26
labs are not focusing on it directly. So
14:28
if you are in a verifiable setting where
14:30
you could create these RL environments
14:31
or examples then that actually sets you
14:34
up to potentially do your own fine
14:35
tuning and you might benefit from that.
14:36
But that is fundamentally technology
14:38
that just works. You can pull a lever if
14:39
you have huge amount of diverse data
14:41
sets of RL environments etc. Uh you can
14:43
use your favorite fine-tuning framework
14:44
and um and uh pull the lever and get
14:47
something that actually uh works pretty
14:49
well. So um I don't know what the
14:51
examples of this might be. Um, but I do
14:54
think there are some very valuable uh
14:56
reinforcement learning environments that
14:58
people could think of that I think are
14:59
not part of the Yeah, I don't want to
15:01
give away the answer, but there is one
15:02
domain that I think is very uh Oh, okay.
15:04
Sorry, I don't mean to vape post on on
15:06
the stage, but there are some examples
15:08
of this.
15:09
On the flip side, what do you think
15:11
still feels automatable only from a
15:13
distance?
15:14
I do think that ultimately almost
15:17
everything can be made uh verifiable to
15:19
some extent. some things easier than
15:21
others. Um because even for like things
15:23
like writing or so on, you can imagine
15:25
having a council of LLM judges and
15:27
probably get get to some get get
15:29
something uh reasonable out of the um
15:31
from from this kind of an approach. So
15:33
it's more about what's easy or hard. Um
15:36
so I I do think that ultimately um uh
15:40
yeah, I think uh
15:42
everything [laughter]
15:43
everything is automatable.
15:45
Amazing. Okay. Um, so last year you
From Vibe Coding to Agent Engineering
15:47
coined the term vibe coding and today
15:49
we're in a world that feels a little bit
15:50
more serious, more regent engineering.
15:52
What do you think is the difference
15:54
between the two and what would you
15:55
actually call what we're in today?
15:57
Uh, yeah. So I would say vibe coding is
15:59
about raising the floor for everyone in
16:01
terms of what they can do in software.
16:03
So the floor rises, everyone can vibe
16:05
code anything and that's amazing,
16:06
incredible. But then I would say agentic
16:08
engineering is about preserving the
16:10
quality bar of what existed before in
16:11
professional software. So you're not
16:13
allowed to introduce vulnerabilities due
16:15
to VIP coding. Um you are um you're
16:18
still responsible for your software just
16:20
as before, but can you go faster? And
16:22
spoiler is you can but how do you how do
16:24
you do that properly? And so to me
16:26
agentic engineering when I call it that
16:28
because I do think it's kind of like an
16:29
engineering discipline. You have these
16:31
agents which are these like spiky
16:32
entities. They're a bit fable, a little
16:33
bit stocastic, but they are extremely
16:35
powerful. is how do you how do you
16:37
coordinate them to go faster without
16:39
sacrificing your quality bar and doing
16:42
that well and correctly um is the the
16:46
realm of agentic engineering um so I
16:48
kind of see them as as different like
16:50
one is about maybe raising the raising
16:51
the floor and the other is about um you
16:53
know extrapolating and what I'm seeing I
16:55
think is there is a very high ceiling on
16:58
agentic engineer uh capability and you
17:01
know people used to talk about the 10x
17:02
engineer previously I think that this is
17:04
magnified a lot more 10x is uh is not uh
17:08
the speed up you gain. Um and I think uh
17:11
it does seem to me like people who are
17:13
very good at this um peak a lot more
17:16
than 10x uh from from my perspective
17:18
right now.
17:18
I really like that framing. Um one thing
17:21
that when Sam Alman came to AIN last
17:23
year, one memorable thing he said was
17:25
that people of different generations use
17:27
chatpt differently. So if you're in your
17:29
30s, you use it as a Google search
17:31
replacement. But if you're in your
17:32
teens, tragic is your gateway to the
17:35
internet. What is the parallel here in
17:37
coding today? If we were to watch two
17:39
people code using OpenClaw, Claude Code,
17:42
Codeex, one you'd consider mediocre at
17:45
it and one you would consider fully AI
17:47
native. How would you describe the
17:49
difference?
17:51
[clears throat]
17:51
I mean I think it's a just trying to get
17:53
the most out of the tools that are
17:55
available utilizing all of their
17:56
features investing into your own um kind
17:59
of setup. Uh so just like previously all
18:02
the engineers are used to basically
18:03
getting the most out of the tools you
18:04
use either it's vim or v code or now
18:06
it's you know cloth code or codec or so
18:09
on. So um just investing into your setup
18:13
um and um utilizing a lot of the you
18:16
know uh tools that are available to you.
18:18
Um and I think it just kind of looks
18:20
like that. I do think that um maybe
18:23
related thought is um a lot of people
18:26
are maybe hiring um for this right
18:29
because they want to hire strong agentic
18:31
engineers. I do think that um what I'm
18:34
seeing is that uh the you know most
18:37
people have still not refactored their
18:39
um their hiring process for a gentic
18:41
engineer capability right like if you're
18:44
giving out puzzles to solve and this is
18:46
still the old paradigm I would say that
18:48
hiring have to has to look like give me
18:50
a really big project and see someone
18:52
implement that big project like let's
18:53
write say a Twitter clone uh for agents
18:57
and then uh make it really good make it
18:59
really secure and then have some agents
19:01
uh simulate some activity uh on this
19:03
Twitter and then I'm going to use 10
19:06
codecs 5.4x for X high to try to break
19:09
your break your um uh this website that
19:12
you deployed and they're going to try to
19:15
basically break it and they should not
19:16
be able to break it. And so maybe it
19:18
looks like that, right? And so yeah,
19:20
watching people in that that setting and
19:21
building bigger uh projects and uh
19:25
utilize utilizing the tooling is maybe
19:26
what I would uh look at for the most
19:28
part.
19:29
And as agents do more, what human skill
19:31
do you think becomes more valuable, not
19:33
less?
19:34
Uh so um yeah, it's a good question. I
19:37
think um well right now the answer is
19:39
that the agents are kind of like these
19:40
intern entities right so it's remarkable
19:44
um you basically still have to be in
19:46
charge of the aesthetics the the
19:48
judgment the taste and a little bit of
19:50
oversight maybe one one of my favorite
19:52
examples of like the the weirdness of
19:54
agents is um for menu genen uh you sign
19:57
up with a Google Google account but you
20:00
um purchase credits using a stripe
20:02
account and both of them have email
20:04
addresses and my agent actually tried to
20:06
basically
20:08
um like when you purchase credits, it
20:10
assigned it using the email address from
20:13
Stripe to the Google email address like
20:15
there wasn't a persistent user ID that
20:18
that uh for people it was trying to
20:20
match up the email addresses, but you
20:21
could use different email address for
20:22
your Stripe and your Google and
20:24
basically would not associate the funds.
20:26
And so this is the kind of thing that
20:28
these agents still will make mistakes
20:29
about is like why would you use email
20:31
addresses to try to crossorrelate the
20:33
funds? They can be arbitrary. You can
20:34
use different emails, etc. Like this is
20:36
such a weird thing to do. So I think
20:39
people have to be in charge of this
20:40
spec, this plan. And um I actually don't
20:43
even like the plan mode. I I would I
20:46
mean obviously it's very useful, but I
20:47
think there's something more general
20:48
here where you have to work with your
20:49
agent to design a spec that is very
20:51
detailed and maybe it's uh maybe
20:53
basically the docs and then get the
20:55
agents to write them and you're in
20:56
charge of the oversight and the top
20:58
level categories, but the agents are
21:00
doing a lot of the under the hood. And
21:02
um so I think you're not caring about
21:04
some of the details. So as an example
21:05
also with um arrays or tensors in neural
21:09
networks. Um there's a ton of details
21:11
between PyTorch and NumPy and all the
21:13
different like pandas and so on for all
21:14
the different little API details. And I
21:17
I already forgot about the keep dims
21:18
versus keep dim or whether it's dim or
21:20
axis or reshape or permute or transpose.
21:22
I don't remember this stuff anymore,
21:24
right? Because you don't have to. This
21:25
is the kind of details that are handled
21:26
by the intern because they have very
21:28
good recall and but you still have to
21:30
know for example that um you know
21:32
there's underlying tensor there's an
21:33
underlying view and then you can
21:35
manipulate view of the same storage or
21:37
you can have different storage which
21:38
would be less efficient and so you still
21:40
have to have an understanding of what
21:41
this stuff is doing and some of the
21:43
fundamentals um so that you're not
21:45
copying memory around unnecessarily and
21:47
so on but uh the details of the APIs are
21:50
now handed off so it um you're in charge
21:53
of the taste the engineering the design
21:55
um and that it makes sense and that
21:57
you're asking for the right things and
21:58
that you're saying that okay that these
21:59
have to be unique user IDs that we're
22:01
going to tie everything to um and so
22:03
you're doing some of the design and
22:06
development and the engineers are doing
22:07
the fill in the blanks and that's
22:08
currently kind of like where we are and
22:10
I think that's what everyone of course
22:11
is seeing I think right now
22:13
do you think there's a chance that this
22:15
um taste and judgment matters less over
22:18
time or will the ceiling just keep
22:20
rising
22:21
um yeah it's a good question I would
22:22
Okay.
22:25
Um, I mean, I'm hoping that the that it
22:28
improves. I think probably the reason it
22:30
doesn't improve right now is again, it's
22:31
not part of the RL. There's probably no
22:33
aesthetics cost or reward or it's not
22:36
good enough or something like that. Um,
22:39
I do think that when you actually look
22:41
at the code, sometimes I get a little
22:42
bit of a heart attack because it's not
22:44
like super amazing code necessarily all
22:46
the time and it's very bloaty and
22:47
there's a lot of copy paste and there's
22:48
awkward abstractions that are brittle
22:50
and like it works but it's just really
22:52
gross. Um, and I do I do hope that this
22:55
can improve in future models. Um, a good
22:57
example also is this uh you know micro
22:59
GPT project which where I was trying to
23:02
simplify uh LLM training to be as simple
23:04
as possible. The models hate this. They
23:06
can't do it. I tried to I keep I kept
23:08
trying to prompt an LLM to simplify more
23:10
simplify more and it just can't you feel
23:13
like you're outside of the RL circuits.
23:15
It feels like you're obviously you know
23:18
you're pulling teeth. It's not like
23:20
light speed. So I think um I do think
23:23
that people are still remain in charge
23:25
of this. But I do think that there's
23:26
nothing fundamental again that's
23:27
preventing it. It's just the labs
23:28
haven't done it yet almost.
23:30
Yeah.
23:31
So I'd love to come back to this idea of
23:33
uh jagged forms of intelligence. you
23:36
wrote a little bit about this with a
23:38
very thoughtprovoking piece around
23:39
animals versus ghosts. Um, and the idea
23:42
is that we're not building animals, we
23:44
are summoning ghosts. Um, and these are
23:46
jagged forms of intelligence that are
23:48
shaped by data and reward functions, but
23:51
not by intrinsic motivation or fun or
23:54
curiosity or empowerment. Uh, things
23:57
that kind of came about via evolution.
24:00
um why does that framing matter and what
24:02
does it actually change about how you
24:04
build and deploy and evaluate or even
24:07
trust them?
24:08
Uh yeah, so yeah, I think the reason I
24:12
wrote about this is because I'm trying
24:13
to wrap my head around what these things
24:15
are, right? Because if you have a good
24:16
model of what they are or are not, then
24:18
you're going to be more competent at uh
24:20
using them. Um and I do think that um I
24:23
don't know if it has I'm not sure if it
24:25
actually has like real power. [laughter]
24:28
I think it's a little bit of
24:29
philosophizing. Um, but I do think that
24:33
um
24:34
I think it's just um coming to terms
24:36
with the fact that these things are not,
24:38
you know, animal intelligences. Like if
24:40
you yell at them, they're not going to
24:41
work better or worse or it doesn't have
24:43
any impact. Um, and uh it's all just
24:46
kind of like these statistical
24:48
simulation circuits where the the
24:50
substrate is pre-training so like
24:53
statistics and then but then there's RL
24:55
bolting on top. So, it kind of like
24:57
increases the dispendages and um maybe
25:00
it's just kind of like a mindset of what
25:02
I'm coming into or what's likely to work
25:04
or not likely to work or how to modify
25:05
it. But I don't actually I don't know
25:07
that I have like here are the five
25:09
obvious outcomes of how to make your
25:11
system better. It's more just being
25:12
suspicious of it and um
25:14
figuring out over time.
25:16
That's where it starts. Um okay, so you
Agents Everywhere and Learning
25:18
are so deep in working with agents that
25:20
don't just chat. They have um real
25:22
permissions. They have local context.
25:24
they actually take action on your be
25:26
your behalf. What does the world look
25:28
like when we all start to live in that
25:30
world?
25:31
Uh yeah, I think I think every a lot of
25:34
people probably here are excited about
25:35
what this agent uh you know native
25:38
agentic environment looks like and
25:40
everything has to be rewritten.
25:41
Everything is still fundamentally
25:42
written for humans and has to be moved
25:44
around. I still use most of the time
25:46
when I use uh different frameworks or
25:48
libraries or things like that, they
25:49
still have docs that are fundamentally
25:51
written for humans. This is my favorite
25:53
pet peeve. Like I don't uh why are
25:55
people still telling me what to do? Like
25:57
I don't want to do anything. What is the
25:58
thing I should copy paste to my agent?
26:00
[laughter] Like uh so it's just um every
26:02
time I'm told, you know, go to this URL
26:04
or something like that, it's just like
26:06
ah [laughter]
26:07
you know. [snorts] So um everyone is I
26:10
think excited about how do we decompose
26:12
the workloads that need to happen into
26:14
fundamentally sensors over the world,
26:16
actuators over the world. How do we make
26:18
it agent native? Uh basically describe
26:20
it to agents first. um and then have a
26:23
lot of automation around um you know the
26:27
um yeah around data structures that are
26:30
very legible to the LLMs. Uh so I think
26:32
um yeah I'm hoping that there's a lot of
26:34
agent first um infrastructure out there
26:36
and that you know for Menuguen famously
26:39
when I wrote the uh not I'm not sure how
26:40
famously but when I wrote the blog post
26:42
about Menuguen [laughter]
26:44
um a lot of the work a lot of the
26:46
trouble was not even writing the code
26:47
for Menugen it was deploying it in
26:48
versell because I had to work with all
26:50
these different services and I had to
26:51
string them up and I had to go to their
26:52
settings and the menus and you know
26:54
configure my DNS and it was just so
26:56
annoying and so that's a good example of
26:59
I would hope that menu gen that I could
27:01
give a prompt to an LLM build menu genen
27:04
and then I didn't have to touch anything
27:05
and it's deployed in that same way on
27:07
the internet. Uh I think that would be a
27:09
good kind of a test for whether or not
27:12
uh a lot of our infrastructure is
27:13
becoming more and more agent native. And
27:14
then ultimately I would say yeah I I do
27:17
think we're going towards a world where
27:19
um there's agent representation for
27:21
people and for organizations and um you
27:25
know I'll have my agent talk to your
27:26
agent uh to figure out some of the
27:28
details of our meetings or or things
27:30
like that. So, [laughter]
27:33
um I do think that that's uh roughly
27:34
where things are going, but um yeah, I
27:36
think everyone here is excited about
27:37
that.
27:38
I really like the visual analogy of
27:40
sensors and actuators. I actually hadn't
27:41
thought of that. That's super
27:42
interesting,
27:43
right?
27:43
Um okay, I think we have to end on a
27:45
question about education. Um because you
27:47
are probably one of the very best in the
27:49
world at making complex technical
27:51
concepts simple and deeply thoughtful
27:53
about how we design education around it.
27:56
Um, what still remains worth learning
27:59
deeply when intelligence gets cheap as
28:02
we move into the next a era of AI?
28:05
Yeah. Uh, there was a tweet that blew my
28:07
mind recently and I keep thinking about
28:09
it like every other day. It was
28:10
something along the lines of um, you can
28:12
outsource your thinking but you can't
28:14
outsource your understanding.
28:16
And um,
28:17
I think that's really nicely put. I so
28:21
yeah because I still I'm still part of
28:23
the system and I still I still have to
28:25
somehow information still has to make it
28:26
into my brain and I feel like I'm
28:27
becoming a bottleneck of just even
28:29
knowing what are we trying to build why
28:30
is it worth doing uh how do I direct you
28:32
know how do I direct my my agents and so
28:34
on so I do still think that ultimately
28:37
something has to direct the thinking and
28:39
the processing and so on and um that's
28:43
still kind of fundamentally constrained
28:44
somehow by understanding and this is one
28:46
reason I also was very excited about all
28:47
the LM knowledge bases because I feel
28:49
like that's that's a way for me to
28:51
process information and anytime I see a
28:53
different projection onto information. I
28:54
always like feel like I gain insight. So
28:56
it's really just a lot of prompts for me
28:58
to do synthetic data generation kind of
29:00
over over some fixed data. Uh so I I
29:03
really enjoy uh whenever I read an
29:05
article I have my uh you know my wiki
29:06
that's being built up from these
29:07
articles and I love asking questions
29:09
about things or um and I I think that
29:12
ultimately these are tools to enhance
29:15
understanding in a certain way and this
29:17
is still kind of like a bit of a
29:18
bottleneck because then you can't direct
29:20
the you can't be a good director if you
29:22
still uh because the LM certainly don't
29:25
excel at understanding you still are
29:26
uniquely in charge of that. So, uh,
29:28
yeah, I think, uh, tools to that effect,
29:31
I think are incredibly interesting and
29:32
exciting.
29:33
I'm excited to be back here in a couple
29:34
years and to see if we've been fully
29:36
automated out of the loop and they
29:38
actually take care of understanding as
29:40
well. Uh, thank you so much for joining
29:41
us, Andre. We really appreciate it.
