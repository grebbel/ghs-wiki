# Durable Skills

The cluster of human skills that remain economically valuable as AI systems take on more codified, procedural, and information-retrieval work. The canonical examples — repeated across the educational, OECD, and labour-economics literatures — are **collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking**, sometimes joined by **communication, problem-solving, self-regulation, and adaptability**.

The wiki's anchor source is [[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al. (Google Research, 2026)]], which uses the term *durable skills* in its title and operationalises measurement for three of them. The terminology is not unique to that paper — the same construct appears in adjacent literatures as *21st-century skills*, *future-ready skills*, *transferable skills*, or simply *human skills*. This concept page treats them as substitutable for now and will note vocabulary drift if/when sources push back on the equivalence.

## Working definition

A **durable skill** is a human skill that is:

1. **Open-ended.** Not specifiable as a closed-form rule or a deterministic procedure (otherwise an AI system can encode and execute it).
2. **Socially or contextually situated.** Performance depends on grounding in a specific group, organisation, or domain in ways an AI system cannot reproduce without that context.
3. **Slow-changing.** The skill itself doesn't go stale every 18 months the way a specific tool or framework might.

The term explicitly contrasts with *codified knowledge* (factual content, procedural rules) which is far more substitutable by foundation models. The wiki's [[ai-deskilling]] concept tracks the substitution direction; this page tracks the inverse — which skills humans should retain and how to measure them.

## The measurement problem

Durable skills are notoriously hard to measure at scale. Three reasons recur in the literature ([[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al.]] §1):

1. **Definitional fluidity.** Different frameworks operationalise "collaboration" or "creativity" differently. The major prior efforts — **PISA 2015** (scripted simulated teammates, multiple-choice answers) and **ATC21S** (Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills, human-human dyads in a digital environment) — span only a small slice of the validity-vs-rigor tradeoff.
2. **Group-task interdependence.** Assessing an *individual* in a collaboration setting is psychometrically hard — other team members introduce uncontrolled variance.
3. **Evidence scarcity.** As Sijtsma (2011) put it, "long-lasting observation of a person in real life until (s)he spontaneously exhibits the behavior of interest would take too much time before enough evidence was collected." Authentic interactions are evidence-thin per minute; structured assessments are evidence-rich per minute but artificial.

The historical compromise was *highly scripted* AI teammates (PISA) or *highly structured* human dyads (ATC21S). Both sacrifice authenticity to measurement reliability.

## Vantage / Executive LLM — the 2026 measurement breakthrough

[[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al.]] introduce **Vantage**, an LLM-orchestrated assessment platform that resolves the validity-vs-rigor tradeoff via two architectural choices:

- **Single Executive LLM driving multiple AI teammates.** Rather than independent agents, one LLM generates responses for *all* AI teammates and is prompted to maximise information about the participant's skill level — analogous to a computerized adaptive test (CAT) but for *complex social/cognitive constructs* rather than item difficulty.
- **Separate AI Evaluator.** A different LLM scores the conversation transcript against multi-dimensional rubrics (linear regression for scores; logistic regression for "no-evidence" labels), with leave-one-out cross-validation.

**Validation (large-N):** 188 participants ages 18-25 (US-based, Prolific), 373 conversations.

| Metric | Result |
| ------ | ------ |
| Inter-human-expert agreement (Cohen's κ) | 0.45–0.64 (moderate) |
| LLM-vs-human-expert agreement (Cohen's κ) | matches inter-human |
| Conversation-level evidence rate (skill-matched Executive LLM) | 92.4% PM, 85% CR |
| Independent Agents (no steering) | significantly less skill-evidence |
| Telling subject "focus on this skill" alone | no significant effect (p > 0.6) |
| Creativity autorater vs human expert (n=180) | **Pearson r = 0.88** |

This is the first scalable, ecologically-valid, psychometrically-controllable durable-skills assessment in the wiki — and arguably in the published literature given the validation rigour. Adds a row to [[ai-benchmarks]].

## Skills measured (Globerson et al. operational definitions)

| Skill | Sub-skills | Conceptual basis |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| **Collaboration** | Conflict Resolution; Project Management | Team cognition (Cannon-Bowers & Salas); shared mental models; grounding (Clark & Brennan 1991) |
| **Creativity** | Generating Ideas (fluidity, originality, quality); Evaluating Ideas (elaborating, selecting); Building on Ideas | Said-Metwaly et al. systematic review; OECD 2019 fostering creativity report; CAT-aligned divergent + convergent thinking |
| **Critical Thinking** | Interpret and Analyze; Evaluate and Judge | Facione (Delphi report 1990); Ennis 1991; Halpern 1998 |

Notable methodological choice in the **critical-thinking** rubric: **AI-Supported Exploration** and **AI-Supported Verification** are explicit sub-categories. Globerson et al. treat AI fluency as a sub-component of critical thinking in 2026, not a confounder. A participant who blindly accepts the AI's output is rated lower than one who uses the AI to fact-check, retrieve specific information, and stress-test arguments. This is a notable update on Facione/Ennis-era critical-thinking definitions.

## Why this matters for the wiki

The durable-skills concept sits at the **intersection of three open questions in the wiki's labor-and-AI cluster**:

1. **What replaces the entry-level pipeline?** [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. (2025)]] showed early-career workers (22-25) in AI-exposed occupations have ~13% relative employment decline since 2022, concentrated in *automation* uses. If durable skills are what differentiate non-substitutable workers, then operationalising them tells us which entry-level training/curriculum still pays — a question the wiki has not been able to answer concretely until now.
2. **Which skills are decaying via [[ai-deskilling]]?** Deskilling is the substitution direction; durable skills are the retention direction. The two concepts together carve up the labor-skill space: codified-and-AI-substitutable vs. open-ended-and-AI-resistant.
3. **What's the operational definition of "AI-augmentative" work?** [[automation-vs-augmentation]] tracks the empirical split between AI uses that substitute for vs complement labor. Durable skills are the *content* of what augmentation augments — if we can measure them at scale, we can audit whether deployments are actually building durable-skill capacity in the workforce or hollowing it out.

## Cross-source positioning (descriptive only)

Other wiki sources have touched the underlying construct without using "durable skills" terminology:

- **Brynjolfsson, Chandar & Chen (2025)** — Canaries in the Coal Mine. Empirical labor-market evidence that *young* workers in AI-exposed occupations are losing employment, but doesn't operationalise *which skills* remain valuable. Durable-skills work is the missing supply-side measurement.
- **AI Index 2025 / 2026** — repeatedly cite McKinsey workforce-reshaping statistics ("46% expect >20% of the workforce to need reskilling") without a clean operational definition of *what* the reskilling targets should be. Durable skills are a candidate answer.
- **Anthropic Economic Index (Q4 2025)** — measures task complexity and AI autonomy at population scale on Claude.ai conversations. Doesn't directly measure individual durable skills, but the "task success" primitive captures something adjacent.
- **[[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves|Anthropic Economic Index 5 — Learning curves (Feb 2026)]]** — quantifies a different kind of *learnable* skill: **AI literacy itself**. High-tenure Claude users achieve **~3-4 percentage points higher task success** than lower-tenure users *after controlling for* task type, model selection, and conversation complexity. Model selection slopes (Opus differentially used for higher-value tasks: +1.48 pp per +$10/hour on Claude.ai; +2.79 pp on the 1P API) demonstrate that *choosing the right model tier* is itself a learnable behaviour visible in usage logs. This is a complementary kind of "durable skill" — not the open-ended, contextually-situated skills the Globerson paper measures, but rather a procedural meta-skill (knowing how to deploy AI well) that nonetheless is *learned-by-doing* and produces measurable productivity returns. Open question for synthesis: is AI-literacy a 5th durable skill alongside collaboration, creativity, critical thinking — or is it a fluency that *enables* the other three to operate in AI-saturated work environments?
- **[[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham et al. 2024 — Learning to Manage Uncertainty, With AI (MIT SMR × BCG)]]** — provides the *organizational-level* counterpart to Globerson's individual-level measurement. The 5-question organizational-learning battery (test-and-learn; failure tolerance; postmortem culture; learning codification; knowledge sharing) and the 4-question AI-specific-learning battery (AI generates new learning; AI learns from performance; human-feedback-loop AI; employees learn from AI) together define *what kind of organizational capacity* AI augments. **Augmented Learners** — the 15% combining both — outperform Limited Learners by 1.6× on uncertainty management and 1.4× on revenue benefits. The construct is *adjacent* to durable skills but at a different layer: durable skills measure individual humans; Augmented Learners measure organizational capacity. Both depend on the same underlying capability — converting tacit knowledge into surfaced, shareable, AI-readable form.
- **[[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026 — How to Reap Compound Benefits From Generative AI]]** — supplies the **strongest claim in the wiki to date** about which durable skill is now *most* economically valuable: **the expert as evaluator**. Direct quote: *"The expert as evaluator is not a transitional role."* Mechanism: where verification compares output against existing standards, **evaluation may generate standards that did not exist before** — and that requires domain expertise. The column reframes durable expertise around a specific operational role (recognizing what "not perfect" actually means; knowing what iteration may reveal). Also names the **Polanyi tacit-dimension breach** — LLMs no longer just codify explicit knowledge; they infer tacit knowledge from behavioral traces at scale. *Tacit expertise was a moat; it is no longer.* This sharpens the durable-skill question: if AI inferences tacit knowledge, what's left for humans? The answer the column proposes: the *judgment to evaluate what AI produces*, which itself depends on having previously developed deep expertise. **Implication**: deploy AI first in domains where your people already have deep expertise, *not* because AI needs hand-holding but because evaluation requires recognizing meaningful gaps. **CLAUDE.md as a worked example**: when developers write CLAUDE.md files specifying what "good" code looks like, *that* is tacit-to-explicit conversion at the team level — operationally identical to what Globerson's Vantage assessment elicits at the individual level.
- **OECD Digital Education Outlook 2026** (cited in Globerson et al. ref [68]) — mainstream educational policy framing of "21st-century skills" matches the durable-skills construct closely.
- **[[2026-05-06-mit-ocw-future-of-mit-open-education|MIT OCW 2026 (Bertsimas / Newton / Hansen)]]** — supplies the construct from the **educational-supply-side** vantage. The wiki's first institutional-leader source on open-education-as-AI-era-skills-investment. MIT OpenLearning's **Universal Learning** architecture (22 modules of Universal AI live as of March 2026; 18 more verticals "cooking"; Universal Climate + Energy / Biology / Health following) is explicitly positioned as the supply-side investment in AI-era skills at scale. **The 1-billion-learners-in-10-years ambition** — *"Aspiring to educate 1 in 8 in the world"* — represents a 2x scale-up over OCW's 25-year trajectory and is only achievable via AI-amplified distribution (translation into 12 languages launching May 2026; personalised education launching summer 2026; AskTIM AI tutor across all modules). Two-axis vocabulary contribution: **personalized vs personalizable materials** (the agent reorganises content for each learner versus the content has the wide-open structure that *enables* reorganisation — Newton's distinction); and **horizontal-knowledge architecture** (AI+x verticals rather than discipline-by-discipline) anticipating that *"the world is organized horizontally"* not vertically. Convergent with Sternfels' *aspiration-setting / judgment / discontinuous-leap-thinking / human-to-human skill* framework from the educational-supply side: Universal Learning's *AI + x* verticals (AI + drug design, AI + satellite data, AI + law, AI + health) are precisely the *AI-meets-domain* skills the McKinsey hiring overhaul prioritises in candidates.
- **[[2026-04-14-thompson-the-daily-workers-letting-ai-do-their-jobs|Thompson 2026 (NYT The Daily)]]** — supplies the construct in **operator vocabulary** from the developer-side. Thompson reports a clean inversion of what developers thought their durable skills were: *"What developers are experiencing right now is something that maybe seems a little paradoxical, which is that they had spent years developing these very, very hard technical skills, and it turns out those are some of the easiest things to automate. The hard stuff to automate is like talking to our colleagues and our customers and figuring out what should we be building. Setting priority, setting strategy. AI can't do that. There are still truly human skills."* The named-by-developers durable skills cluster reduces to: **communication / spec-elicitation / priority-setting / strategy / deciding-what-to-build**. Direct convergence with the Globerson collaboration / critical-thinking / creativity framework and with Sternfels' aspiration-setting / judgment / discontinuous-leap-thinking / human-to-human framework — three sources from three vantages (Google Research psychometrics, McKinsey GMP hiring criteria, NYT journalism field-report) now name overlapping but non-identical sub-skill clusters. Synthesis target: map the three skill-vocabularies onto a common taxonomy.
- **[[2026-02-09-sternfels-mckinsey-survive-ai-and-reinvent-consulting|Sternfels 2026 (HBR IdeaCast / McKinsey)]]** — supplies the construct from the **hiring-criteria angle**. Sternfels names *four* durable leadership skills models lack: (1) **aspiration-setting** (*"They're not good at setting the right aspiration level. Great leaders help an organization set the right ask: what should we aspire to?"*), (2) **judgment** (*"There's not truth in the model. There's not judgment in the model. Humans need to impose those parameters."*), (3) **discontinuous-leap thinking** (*"They're great at a linear approach to problem solving. What they're not great at is discontinuous leaps, truly novel thinking."* — McKinsey is now consciously rebalancing toward liberal-arts undergraduate degrees), and (4) **human-to-human skill** (built via team sports / retail jobs / real-world group work). McKinsey applied 20 years of internal analytics to its own hires and surfaced three biggest predictors of partner-track success that mainstream credentials *under-weighted*: **resilience-after-setback** beats perfect marks; **team-sport / retail-job experience** under-weighted; **aptitude-to-learn-novel-stuff** beats subject-mastery — the firm now deliberately tests candidates in *no-pattern-recognition* assessment environments. This is the wiki's first *industrial selection-instrument validation* of the durable-skills frame: McKinsey isn't measuring durable skills *in workers post-hoc*, it's measuring them *in candidates pre-hire* and changing what gets weighted. Direct convergence with the Globerson collaboration / creativity / critical-thinking framework, articulated in vendor self-narrative rather than psychometric form.
- **[[2026-04-21-forsgren-macvean-build-core-skills-thrive-ai-era-developer|Forsgren & Macvean 2026 (Google I/O / Developer Intelligence team)]]** — supplies the construct from the **engineering-role-evolution vantage**, with a structural model: the **evolved T-shaped engineer** with four skill domains. Vertical stem = deep core SWE specialisation (*more important, not less*); horizontal bar adds a new layer of **AI engagement** (steering, eval design, output assessment); and the wings extend into **Adjacent Engineering** (cybersec, privacy, deployment infra) and **Adjacent Non-Engineering** (business / user context). The Adjacent-Non-Engineering wing is the talk's name for the same skill cluster Globerson et al. measure as collaboration / creativity / critical thinking, and the same cluster Thompson reports developers naming as *communication / spec-elicitation / priority-setting / strategy*, here packaged as the **value-translator** role: *"engineers are increasingly acting as value translators, taking the user needs and business needs to precise requirements."* The talk's one-line synthesis of what humans keep when agents take execution — ***"delegate tasks, not judgment"*** (used twice) — is the most quotable single articulation in the wiki to date of the durable-skill boundary. Two further contributions: (a) **identity threat** as a labelled phenomenon (citing DORA research) — *"many developers are currently feeling a very real identity threat... we need to shift how we measure our worth"* — the engineering-side correlate of the broader [[ai-employment-effects]] role-content shift; (b) explicit **convergence claim across disciplines**: *"software engineering isn't the only discipline getting more T-shaped — we are seeing this exact same evolution in our product managers, our UX researchers, and more"* — the multi-role articulation of the durable-skills cluster's becoming-the-shared-job-description trajectory. Same parent organisation as Globerson et al. (both Google Research-lineage); the two together form a paired engineering / psychometrics view of the same skill cluster.

- **[[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai|Storoni 2026 (HBR IdeaCast)]]** — supplies a **regulation meta-skill** on top of the conventional durable-skills cluster: *self-regulation under AI-era uncertainty pressure* — specifically, the ability to stay at the **top edge of gear-2** (slightly apprehensive, jittery, but self-controlled) without tipping into gear-3 panic. The neuroscience claim: when you encounter a situation more uncertain than you want it to be, your brain releases norepinephrine, which *both* causes the subjective tension *and* primes neural plasticity for learning. Workers who can stay at that top-of-gear-2 edge get the maximum learning benefit; workers who flee into avoidance or tip into gear-3 panic lose the priming. *"Learning how to control yourself, regulate your brain from tipping into gear three ... that is the state that, if we can train ourselves to embrace it, will last us and take us far through this era of rapid change."* This is **not a fourth durable skill** alongside collaboration / creativity / critical thinking — it is the **operating condition** under which the conventional three become exercisable. Storoni's other contributions to the durable-skills picture: the *"we have now effectively all become AI managers"* framing (durable skill = working at the management/judgment layer, not the tool-execution layer), the *intrinsic-motivation / learning-progress mechanism* (durable engagement under conditions where external scaffolds have failed), and the *counter-intuitive boredom fix* (oversight work — increasingly common as AI takes execution — needs harder tasks and more feedback channels, not simpler ones). Per [[../../CLAUDE.md#lifecycle|Lifecycle confidence rules]] this single-source popularisation contribution does not lift concept confidence; its value is *expanding the meta-layer* of the durable-skills picture rather than confirming the empirical cluster.
- **[[2026-02-09-ross-schneider-adaptability|Ross & Schneider 2026 (HBR Partner Content / Egon Zehnder)]]** — centers **adaptability** as the *primary* durable skill of the AI era, with the rhetorical move *"Adaptability is the new resilience."* Three layers of operationalisation: (i) **how leaders lead** — continuously restructure agile teams, harness diverse perspectives, nurture *"creative abrasion"* (Linda Hill), bring the outside in; (ii) **how they hire** — reframe job descriptions from tasks to challenges, look for candidates who have adapted before, interview for *what new skills they have learned* and *what they have recently changed their mind about*; (iii) **how they build their own muscle** — seek minor discomfort, reframe situations, practise adapting. Empirical anchor: Egon Zehnder survey of **1,200+ global CEOs**; **92% agreement** with the statement that adapting *"beyond anything I've previously imagined"* is now required. **Source-quality caveat**: this is HBR.org **Partner Content** (sponsored / advertorial) — the survey methodology is not disclosed, the framing strategically positions Egon Zehnder's leadership-advisory offering, and per the wiki's [[../../CLAUDE.md#lifecycle|Lifecycle vendor-source rule]] this source **does not raise the concept's confidence**. What it does add: a centerpiece treatment of adaptability that the wiki's other sources mention only in passing, and a direct hiring-criteria convergence with Sternfels above (both 9 Feb 2026; Sternfels names "aptitude-to-learn-novel-stuff", Ross-Schneider names "interview for what new skills they have learned" — same construct from two consulting-firm self-narratives on the same date).

The construct is recurring; the operational measurement is new in 2026; the vendor-narrative centering of adaptability specifically is new in early 2026 (Ross-Schneider).

## Open questions and limitations

- **Cultural situatedness.** Globerson et al. explicitly acknowledge: "human skills are culturally situated, and will therefore also focus future work on exploring performance across diverse cultural settings and languages to ensure our technology is inclusive and equitable." Current empirical results are US, English-speaking, ages 18-25. Generalisation is a real open question.
- **Construct validity vs criterion validity.** The Vantage validation establishes construct validity (the test measures the construct as defined by the rubric). It does *not* establish criterion validity (the score predicts real-world outcomes — manager reports, teacher reports over semesters, downstream career success). Criterion validity is the gold standard but is "largely impractical" to collect at scale, per the paper.
- **Single-source operational definition.** The wiki has only one source operationalising the durable-skills construct so far. The terminology cluster (durable skills / 21st-century skills / future-ready skills / human skills) is consensus across the broader literature, but a 2nd ingest would substantially raise confidence and surface vocabulary disagreements.
- **Are durable skills actually durable under sustained AI augmentation?** [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond (2025)]] showed augmentation under deliberate human-in-the-loop design produces +15% productivity and equalising effects — but also small quality declines among top performers. If the AI's training data degrades because skilled humans lean on it instead of producing original judgments, do "durable skills" stay durable? Open question.

## Debates and supersession

## *Expert generalists* + *renaissance developer* + the Anthropic-competition exhibit ([[2026-05-21-allen-aws-london-exec-forum-agentic-team-structures|Allen / AWS London Exec Forum 2026]])

Allen's keynote names two vocabularies adjacent to *durable skills* at AWS-Executive-in-Residence altitude: **expert generalists** (Martin Fowler's term, recommended by Allen) and **renaissance developer** (Werner Vogels' final re:Invent 2025 keynote framing). Both describe the shape of the worker whose skill profile survives the agentic transition: *"domain experts pushing outward; generalists deepening their domain expertise"* — the meeting point in the middle is the renaissance developer / expert generalist.

The empirical anchor Allen offers is the **Anthropic competition exhibit** (~17:55–18:30): in a recent Anthropic-run agent-building competition, **1st place went to a lawyer, 2nd place to a cardiologist from Poland** (who built an AI-agentic patient-care platform that guides patients after they leave the doctor's office, *"flying around the world with just Wi-Fi to build this"*), **3rd place to another cardiologist**. *"No developer in the top three."* Allen's reading: *"Think in your business: who has the domain knowledge?"*

The wiki's reading: the Globerson et al. durable-skills measurement battery (collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, contextual reasoning) is *necessary but not sufficient* to describe the renaissance-developer skill profile. The Anthropic-competition exhibit adds the dimension of **domain expertise × tool-fluency** as the differentiator — durable skills enable judgment under uncertainty, but the *competitive advantage* in the agentic era goes to those who can pair deep domain expertise with goal-based-agent tool-fluency. This is the AWS-vendor-altitude framing of *what durable skills compose with to win in the agentic era* — a complement to the supply-side measurement question Globerson et al. answer.

## The MGI Skill Change Index as a labour-market-data-grounded systematic measure ([[2025-11-25-yee-mgi-agents-robots-and-us-skill-partnerships|Yee et al. / MGI 2025]])

[[2025-11-25-yee-mgi-agents-robots-and-us-skill-partnerships|MGI's *Agents, Robots, and Us*]] (November 2025) introduces the **Skill Change Index (SCI)** — the wiki's first labour-market-data-grounded systematic measure of which skills will change most and least under AI automation. Three properties make the SCI a useful complement to the wiki's prior durable-skills vocabularies (Globerson et al. assessment methodology, Storoni's neuroscience-vantage self-regulation-under-uncertainty, Schoening's agency-as-durable-skill):

**(a) Coverage**: 6,800 employer-cited skills from Lightcast across ~1,800 US occupations. Not a hand-selected list of "AI-era skills" — every skill with >5% job-posting prevalence in the US labour market. The breadth makes the SCI a *systematic* baseline rather than a vantage-specific framing.

**(b) Time-weighted decomposition methodology**. Each skill is scored on the fraction of associated time spent on automatable work activities, weighted by occupation employment. Skills with **55%+ time-spent in non-automatable work activities** are classified people-led; **55%+ in automatable** are AI-led (further divided into agent-led / robot-led depending on physical-capability requirement); all others are shared. The classification is **time-spent-weighted, not capability-binary** — a skill can be people-led even if some of its hours overlap with AI-capable tasks, as long as the dominant usage is in non-automatable work. The mapping uses **OpenAI GPT-4o** for ~3.4M occupation-DWA-skill labellings with a **manual 1,000-cell template** for validation + iterative prompt refinement.

**(c) Scenario-bracketed forecasts**. Two adoption scenarios for 2030: *midpoint* (the report's primary lens) and *early* (faster diffusion). The SCI quartile values differ markedly across scenarios — midpoint top-quartile 33% exposure vs early-scenario top-quartile 59% — making the uncertainty band transparent. The wiki can therefore cite *which skills are durable under both scenarios* (the bottom-quartile and lower-middle-quartile skills) with confidence-graded weight.

**The SCI's three skill-evolution paths**:
1. **Top quartile (highly exposed → will decline in demand)**: specialised skills like specific programming languages (SQL programming), accounting processes, invoicing, basic technical knowledge.
2. **Middle quartiles (will evolve in nature and application, not rise or fall)**: transferable skills + **AI fluency itself** is in this band — communication, customer relations, detail orientation, management, writing, quality assurance.
3. **Bottom quartile (will endure)**: skills grounded in human connection and care — **leadership, coaching, negotiation, mentorship, healthcare skills, good driving record**.

**By skill category (Exhibit 13, share of skills in each SCI exposure band)**:

| Category | Low (durable) | Moderate | High (declining) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Assisting and caring | **54%** | 36% | 10% |
| Communication, collaboration, creativity | 28% | 58% | 14% |
| Management skills | 29% | 49% | 22% |
| Handling and moving | 29% | 42% | 29% |
| Constructing | 25% | 44% | 31% |
| Working with machinery + equipment | 18% | 55% | **27%** |
| Information skills | 18% | 53% | **29%** |
| **Digital skills** | 11% | 47% | **42%** |

The **assisting-and-caring** category is the wiki's most-protected durable-skills cluster (54% low-exposure, only 10% high-exposure); the **digital-skills** category is the most-exposed (42% high-exposure). The pattern matches Globerson et al.'s collaboration / creativity / critical-thinking measurement battery being the assessment-methodology for *moderate-exposure* skills, while [[ai-employment-effects]] data shows **moderate-exposure skills will evolve, not decline**.

**Eight high-prevalence transferable skills** that endure across the workforce, with explicit splits between what humans vs agents will do (Exhibit 11):

| Skill | Relevance % | Agents/Robots will | People will |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Communication | 99 | Generate content, accelerate data flow | Refine nuance and storytelling |
| Management | 94 | Automate scheduling, monitor metrics | Coach and lead hybrid teams |
| Operations | 84 | Execute routine tasks, optimise efficiency | Design smarter processes and strategise |
| Problem-solving | 83 | Identify patterns, propose options | Interpret findings, make judgments |
| Leadership | 83 | Drive change, support decision-making | Guide and motivate teams |
| Detail orientation | 80 | Run quality checks, flag anomalies | Audit outputs, validate outcomes |
| Customer relations | 80 | Route requests, handle routine queries | Strengthen loyalty, build relationships |
| Writing | 76 | Produce drafts, propose revisions | Refine text, craft story |

The framing — *AI does the quantity, humans do the quality* — is convergent with [[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai|Storoni's neuroscience-vantage reframe]] of efficiency (gear-3 quantity / gear-2 quality) now at structural-modeling altitude.

The SCI is the wiki's strongest **structural-prospective** anchor on which skills are durable. Joins [[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al.]]'s **measurement-methodology** layer (how to test for durable skills), Storoni's **neuroscience** layer (what makes a skill durable under uncertainty), Schoening's **personal-agency** framing (which mindset-traits compound into durable skills), and Forsgren & Macvean's **engineering-team-core-skills** vocabulary (which 10 capabilities matter for AI-era developers). The five-source convergence on the durable-skills concept is now multi-altitude — measurement + neuroscience + agency + engineering-team + structural-modeling.

## The Coursera *120% YoY critical-thinking enrollment growth* demand-side anchor + Kocherlakota *end-to-end systems thinking* prescription ([[2026-05-28-giles-wp-intelligence-new-human-machine-workforce-agentic-ai-jobs|Giles / WP Intelligence May 2026]])

[[2026-05-28-giles-wp-intelligence-new-human-machine-workforce-agentic-ai-jobs|Giles (May 2026)]] supplies the wiki's first **demand-side empirical anchor** on the durable-skills market — measured at learner level, not employer-side:

> *"In its 2026 Job Skills Report, online learning platform Coursera surveyed more than 6 million learners across nearly 7,000 organizations and reported a 120 percent year-over-year increase in enrollments in courses on critical thinking."*

A 120% YoY enrollment jump in *critical-thinking* courses across a 6M-learner sample is the wiki's strongest single-line demand-side signal that durable-skills training is materialising as an active labor-market behaviour rather than only a prescriptive recommendation. Convergent with the MGI Skill Change Index *AI-fluency-demand-grew-6.8×-in-two-years* finding on the supply-side / employer-posting end — the Coursera data is the workers'-side complement (learners actively enrolling rather than employers actively posting).

The accompanying executive-altitude **end-to-end-systems-thinking** prescription Giles surfaces, from **Swamy Kocherlakota** (Zscaler, agentic-AI lead): *"A lot of things companies currently do in silos will be collapsed because of AI. That's why the skill set that's going to be most needed is end-to-end systems thinking."* + (separately) *"If you are working like a robot, your job will be taken by a robot."* The wiki's clearest single-source articulation of the **what-skill-survives-the-silos-collapse** question. Convergent with the existing Globerson-et-al. measurement framework (the four sub-skills include *AI-supported critical thinking* and *novel reasoning* — sister concepts to *systems thinking*) and with Storoni's gear-2 neuroscience framing (the cognitive state in which systems-thinking is even possible).

Plus the **UiPath case-study-vs-online-training** worked example Giles cites (Agi Garaba, UiPath CPO): *"online training ... is useful for helping people understand the fundamental concepts of softer skills. But she has found the most effective way to develop those skills is to bring groups of employees together to work on actual case studies — and to listen to UiPath leaders sharing relevant personal experiences."* The wiki's first practitioner-altitude statement that **softer-skills training is more effective via case-study practice + leader storytelling than via abstract online courses** — a pedagogical finding worth tracking against the durable-skills *measurement* literature ([[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al.]]). The pairing implies: measurement methodology + case-study-based pedagogy may need to co-evolve.

## Upskilling over hiring: the institutional-knowledge case ([[2026-05-01-lf-state-of-tech-talent-global-2026|LF Global]] + [[2026-06-01-lf-state-of-tech-talent-europe-2026|LF Europe]] 2026)

The two 2026 [[The Linux Foundation|Linux Foundation]] *State of Tech Talent* reports ([[Marco Gerosa]] & [[Adrienn Lawson]]) reframe durable skills from a *measurement* problem into an **organisational-strategy** one: given an AI-era skills gap, do you **upskill existing staff** or **hire externally**? The survey answer is emphatic and quantified:

- **Upskilling is the primary response** (57% global / 63% Europe), ahead of external hiring, rated important by **94%** of organisations — and explicitly favoured *over* hiring: **7.9× for business context, 7.7×/5.6× for retention, 7.3×/6.3× for team cohesion, 5×/5.8× for lower total cost** (global / Europe). Organisations are **3.5–3.7× more likely to upskill than hire** across strategic domains.
- **Why: institutional knowledge is a durable asset.** The reports' framing — *"upskilled talent doesn't take wing and fly, they grow roots"* — treats upskilling as **institutional-knowledge preservation**, not just gap-closing. External hiring is slower and riskier: new hires take **53% longer** to reach productivity and **23% resign within six months**. This is the workforce-economics complement to the durable-skills thesis: the skills worth measuring are also the skills worth *retaining and deepening in place*.
- **Skills-over-credentials at the hiring gate.** Degrees/titles/years-of-experience are "proving insufficient" as roles change faster than those signals; **certifications (important to 76% of hiring managers)** and demonstrated job-relevant skills are the rising trust signals — and **technical training (93%) ranks above compensation (91%/83%)** as a retention strategy. (Interest-alignment caveat: the publisher sells certifications; see the source pages.)
- **The pipeline-investment corollary** ([[2026-06-01-lf-state-of-tech-talent-europe-2026|Europe report]]): with entry-level technical roles contracting (−3% in Europe), upskilling becomes not only gap-closing for current staff but a **pipeline investment** for the mid-to-senior talent organisations will need — tying durable-skills development directly to the [[ai-employment-effects]] entry-level-decline finding.

This sits alongside the page's *measurement* spine ([[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al.]]) and the MGI Skill Change Index: measure which durable skills matter, then **develop them in-house** as the dominant organisational strategy.

## The mindset-not-skillset inversion ([[2026-06-12-argenti-hbr-thrive-alongside-ai-mindset-not-skillset|Argenti / HBR June 2026]])

[[2026-06-12-argenti-hbr-thrive-alongside-ai-mindset-not-skillset|Marco Argenti]] (CIO, [[Goldman Sachs]]) supplies the wiki's sharpest **counter-framing** to the skills-inventory approach this page otherwise documents. The standard durable-skills move is to *identify and retain* the skills AI can't substitute. Argenti argues the framing of preservation is itself the trap: when a banker asks "what's the 10% of my job AI will never do?", his answer is **"let go of that 10%."**

- **The horse-rider→car-driver analogy.** None of the specific *skills* transfer from riding to driving; what transfers is the **reflexes and instincts** — and the durable human residue Argenti names is **instincts, judgement, and values**, not any task-skill. This aligns with the wiki's measured durable skills (critical thinking, collaboration, judgement) but reframes them as a *substrate that survives role-metamorphosis* rather than a list to defend.
- **From skillset to mindset.** "Don't just reskill, reimagine skills and build new habits." The durable capability is the *capacity to let trusted habits die and adopt a new professional identity* — a meta-skill above any catalogued competency. The hardest part, Argenti notes, is personal and cultural, not technical.
- **Convergence with the wiki's judgement spine.** This restates, from a first-party CIO vantage, the [[2026-02-09-sternfels-mckinsey-survive-ai-and-reinvent-consulting|Sternfels/McKinsey]] claim that judgement and human-to-human skill are what models lack — and operationalises it as a *posture* (operator → supervisor/mentor) rather than a training curriculum.

## Rising skill thresholds + AI fluency as a tenure-complement ([[2026-04-03-bcg-emerson-kropp-ai-will-reshape-more-jobs-than-it-replaces|BCG / Emerson, Kropp et al. 2026]])

BCG's labor-disruption report turns the durable-skills thesis into a **workforce-economics claim**: as AI absorbs routine execution, **skill thresholds rise** — "redesigned roles will demand greater expertise, oversight, and accountability… the more durable roles tend to require higher credentials and greater seniority." Durable skills aren't just *what survives*; they become a **barrier to entry** (higher credential bars, transition friction) even where headcount holds. Two BCG specifics sharpen the page:

- **AI fluency becomes a complement to tenure.** Readiness for augmented, higher-order roles is assessed increasingly on *whether you proactively adopt AI tools and rethink the work* — sometimes advantaging **AI-fluent juniors and recent graduates** over more-experienced staff. This is the demand-side mirror of the [[2026-05-28-giles-wp-intelligence-new-human-machine-workforce-agentic-ai-jobs|Coursera 120% critical-thinking-enrollment]] signal and complicates the simple "seniors win" reading: the durable bundle is *judgment + AI fluency*, and fluency is age-agnostic.
- **Frequent, not one-time, upskilling.** BCG's CEO directive is that workers "will likely require more frequent (versus one-time) upskilling as the technology evolves," with structured redeployment pathways per role-segment — making durable-skills development a *continuous* organizational function, not a one-shot reskilling event (echoing the [[2026-05-01-lf-state-of-tech-talent-global-2026|Linux Foundation]] upskill-over-hire finding).
