# Automation vs. Augmentation

A conceptual distinction that recurs across the wiki's sources with growing empirical weight: **does this AI deployment substitute for human labor (automation), or complement it (augmentation)?** The choice has consequences in three layers — strategy (where to deploy), task design (how to integrate), and labor markets (who keeps their job).

This page treats **automation vs. augmentation** as a standalone analytical lens, distinct from [[ai-agents]] (the technology), [[ai-employment-effects]] (the labor consequences), and [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] (the organizational decision-making).

## Working definition

The cleanest definition in the wiki comes from the [[Anthropic Economic Index]] used in [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]]:

- **Automative use** — Claude conversations classified as "Directive" (complete task delegation with minimal interaction) or "Feedback Loop" (task completion guided by environmental feedback such as repeatedly relaying coding errors to the model). The AI is doing the work; the human is monitoring or absent.
- **Augmentative use** — conversations classified as "Task Iteration" (collaborative refinement), "Learning" (knowledge acquisition and understanding), or "Validation" (work verification and improvement). The human is doing the work, with AI as a tool/partner.
- "None" — neither substituting nor complementing, e.g., chitchat or exploration.

Note that these are **task-level** distinctions, not occupation-level. The same occupation can have both automative and augmentative AI uses; the empirical question is which dominates.

## Why this distinction matters

### 1. Strategic deployment ([[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]])

The Anand-Wu 2×2 — cost of errors × type of knowledge — implicitly maps to automation vs. augmentation:

| Quadrant | Automation/augmentation orientation |
|---|---|
| **No regrets zone** (low cost / explicit) | Pure **automation** — AI does it all, no human in the loop. Bulk customer inquiries, document summarization, résumé screening. |
| **Creative catalyst zone** (low cost / tacit) | **Augmentation** — AI creates options, human selects. Marketing taglines, design variations. |
| **Quality control zone** (high cost / explicit) | **Augmentation with strict verification** — AI produces, human verifies. Contract drafting (Harvey), code generation (Copilot), due diligence. |
| **Human-first zone** (high cost / tacit) | **Light augmentation** — Human leads, AI assists with minor tasks. Strategy, hiring, disciplinary decisions. |

Anand-Wu's strategic recommendation: deploy aggressively in the no-regrets zone (automation), use AI as a creative or quality-control partner elsewhere (augmentation), keep humans firmly in the lead in the human-first zone.

### 2. Task design ([[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]])

[[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]] frames the distinction as a question of **agency and oversight**: *"It's not about replacing roles. It's about where we can give agency, with some human oversight and governance, to improve tasks within a workflow."* — [[Liz Centoni]], Cisco.

The chatbot → agent → multi-agent progression is a progression along the automation axis: more agency to AI, less direct human intervention.

### 3. Labor market consequences ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]])

The strongest empirical signal in the wiki for why this distinction matters: **employment outcomes diverge sharply by automation vs. augmentation use.**

- Occupations with highest **automation share**: declining employment for early-career workers (22–25).
- Occupations with highest **augmentation share**: **NO** similar pattern — most-augmentative quintile shows fastest growth.

> "Consistent with automative uses of AI substituting for labor while augmentative uses do not." — [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]] Fact 3.

This finding is the wiki's first **measurable empirical correlate** of a distinction that has otherwise lived as a strategic or philosophical framing.

### 4. Maturity progression ([[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR]])

[[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR]]'s Stage 4 ("AI future-ready") is described as "combining traditional, generative, agentic, and robotic AI" — which implies firms at that stage are deploying AI across the full automation/augmentation spectrum. Lower stages tend to lean augmentative (LLMs as tools); higher stages move toward more automation (agents, autonomous workflows).

### 5. Productivity gains under augmentation ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|primary source]])

The wiki's primary anchor for **augmentation's positive productivity effects** is [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond (2025) "Generative AI at Work" QJE]]. The paper studies a customer-support AI that was **explicitly designed to augment**, not replace:

- AI shows real-time suggestions only to the agent
- Agents have **full discretion** to accept, edit, or ignore
- The system **declines to suggest** when training data is insufficient — leaving agents to respond on their own
- Authors describe this as "designed to augment (rather than replace) human agents"

Headline result: **+15% productivity** with strong equalizing effect (low-skill +30%, high-skill ~0% with small quality decline). This is the wiki's cleanest empirical demonstration that **augmentation under deliberate human-in-the-loop design produces positive labor outcomes**. The [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]]-cited productivity studies (Dell'Acqua 2023 consulting, Cui 2024 software, Hoffman 2024 software) replicate the pattern across other domains.

We do **not** have equivalent rigorous studies of *pure-automation* productivity gains in the wiki — because pure automation replaces the worker entirely, so "productivity per worker" is no longer a coherent measurement. The closest empirical signal we have for automation effects is occupation-level employment data ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson 2025 Canaries]]) showing entry-level employment declines in automate-able roles.

### 6. Longitudinal split on Claude.ai ([[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|Anthropic Economic Index, 4th report]] → [[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves|5th report]])

The [[Anthropic Economic Index]] tracks the augmentation/automation split on Claude.ai across reports. The current trajectory, now extended through February 2026:

| Sample period | Augmentation | Automation |
|---|---|---|
| January 2025 | 55% | 41% |
| March 2025 | 55% | 42% |
| August 2025 | 47% | 49% |
| November 2025 | 52% | 45% |
| **February 2026** | **53%** | **45%** |

Augmentation has led in four of five samples; the August 2025 sample remains the only one where automation led. Across the most recent quarter (Nov 2025 → Feb 2026), the split has been **stable, not drifting toward automation** — a noteworthy finding given headline narratives that agentic deployment is rapidly displacing collaborative use.

**Emergent automation patterns on the 1P API** (5th report, Feb 2026): three task clusters where automation share climbed sharply on the enterprise API endpoint between Aug 2025 and Feb 2026 — *first-line sales* (rising directive use of Claude in outbound sales workflows), *programmatic trading and brokerage* (automated financial-decision pipelines), and *coding agent harnesses* (Claude Code splitting work into many short directive calls). These are the three places where API automation is genuinely accelerating, even as the Claude.ai consumer split holds roughly flat. The divergence between consumer (mostly stable, augmentation-leaning) and API (automation rising in specific clusters) is a load-bearing methodological caveat: aggregate "AI is automating work" framings should specify which surface and which cluster.

### 7. Differentiated vs. independent search as fine-grained augmentation patterns ([[2026-04-29-boussioux-crowdless-future|Boussioux et al. 2024]])

A field study with [[Continuum Laboratory]] and Freelancer.com on circular-economy ideation distinguishes two human-AI search modes:

- **Independent search** — one initial prompt → multiple GPT-4 instances generate solutions independently; approximates parallel-path crowdsourcing.
- **Differentiated search** — one initial prompt + iterative *differentiation instructions* after each output ("tackle a different problem"); converts the LLM's tendency-toward-the-mean into a controllable parameter.

Empirical pattern in the study (300 evaluators, 3,900 evaluator-solution pairs):

| Dimension | Human Crowd | HAI multi-instance | HAI single-instance (differentiated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Novelty | **Highest** | Lowest | Comparable to HC |
| Strategic viability | Lower | Comparable | **Highest** |
| Environmental value | Lowest | Higher | **Highest** |
| Financial value | Lowest | Higher | **Highest** |
| Overall quality | Lowest | Comparable to HC | **Highest** |

The differentiated/single-instance configuration is the more interesting augmentation pattern — it preserves novelty while delivering value/quality gains over both HC and the multi-instance HAI baseline.

### 8. The Pareto-improvement caveat ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond 2025]])

A subtle finding worth flagging: augmentation under the customer-support AI is **not strictly Pareto-improving**. Top performers experience small speed gains AND **small quality declines**. The mechanism: top performers increase adherence to AI recommendations even when those recommendations are slightly worse than what they would have produced unaided.

Two implications:
- **Distributional**: augmentation reliably benefits low-skill workers but may marginally harm top performers' output quality.
- **Long-run training-data risk**: if top performers reduce their original contributions, the AI's training data degrades over time. The AI's effectiveness on novel problems depends on continued original problem-solving from skilled workers.

This is a genuine wrinkle in the "augmentation is benign / automation is contested" framing — even augmentation has distributional and long-run dynamics that the headline numbers obscure.

### 9. Buy-Outcomes as the most automative deployment model ([[2026-05-05-nishar-nohria-end-of-one-size-fits-all|Nishar & Nohria 2026]])

Nishar & Nohria's four-model framework (Build / Compose / Collaborate / **Buy Outcomes**) for the firm-boundary decision under [[generative-ai]] surfaces a useful refinement of the automation-vs-augmentation cut: **Buy Outcomes is the most automative model in the spectrum.**

When a firm contracts for "accurate financials, compliance, and reporting as a service" rather than licensing accounting software and operating it internally, the entire job — not just discrete tasks — is automated by the vendor. The named industry signal: **Adobe's outcome-based pricing for its CX Enterprise + agentic AI tools**, where Adobe deploys agents directly with the customer and charges per outcome (e.g., successful ad campaigns) rather than per seat or per token. This is the operational shape of "AI does the work; the human is monitoring or absent" pushed to the firm-boundary level.

By contrast, the **Build** model is closer to deep augmentation of a firm's distinctive workflows — the system encodes *the firm's* data and decision logic, not the vendor's. The four models can therefore be ordered roughly along the automation-vs-augmentation axis:

| Nishar-Nohria model | Closest to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Buy Outcomes | Pure automation (firm-level) | Vendor takes responsibility for the whole job |
| Collaborate | Mostly automation | Provider's forward-deployed engineers build the system; firm consumes it |
| Compose | Augmentation of business-user workflows | Business users configure scaffolding to their own motion |
| Build | Deep augmentation of distinctive workflows | The firm's own data and decision logic become the system |

This refines the wiki's task-level cut into a complementary firm-boundary cut: **at the task level, Anand-Wu's "no regrets zone" is where automation thrives; at the firm-boundary level, Nishar-Nohria's "Buy Outcomes" is where firms cede the whole function**. Both work best on **non-differentiating** territory; both become risky when performance there starts shaping competitive advantage.

Caveat: Nishar-Nohria explicitly warn that the choice of model is **not primarily a cost or feasibility decision** anymore — it is a strategic decision about where differentiation matters. This is the firm-boundary analogue of Anand-Wu's task-level "where to deploy GenAI today" question.

### 10. Reliability is the gating dimension for the automation/augmentation cut ([[2026-03-20-huggingface-agentic-evaluations-workshop|Narayanan / Princeton, HF Agentic Evals Workshop 2026]])

[[Arvind Narayanan|Narayanan]]'s release-decision frame **operationalises** the automation-vs-augmentation cut at the deployment-readiness layer:

> *"In a coding agent, many of these errors are maybe not too bad because the programmer is still in the loop and they're reviewing the code. But in a customer service agent, you want the agent to autonomously handle customers. These are much worse errors. Reliability really matters in automation tasks as opposed to augmentation tasks."*

The structural claim:

- **Augmentation deployments** can tolerate substantial unreliability because a human is in the loop validating each step — the coding agent at 70% reliability is still net-positive because the programmer reviews and corrects the 30%.
- **Automation deployments** require a high reliability threshold by construction — the autonomous customer-service agent at 90% reliability is dead-on-arrival because the 10% failures interact with the world (wrong order placed, wrong information given, customer trust burned) before any human can intervene.

The release-decision corollary: *"For release decisions, it's not just capability that matters. It's also some reliability threshold that needs to be met before you decide to deploy an agent."* Capability and reliability are orthogonal — Narayanan's team decomposes reliability into 12 sub-dimensions, most of which are unsolved (see [[ai-benchmarks]]). This means the automation-vs-augmentation cut is not just about *whether the AI does the work* but about *whether the AI is reliable enough to do the work autonomously* — a much higher bar than capability benchmarks currently measure.

This complements [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson's Fact 3]] (automation displaces, augmentation doesn't) with the **upstream gating mechanism**: a deployment that *could* be automation often *should* be augmentation today because reliability hasn't crossed threshold yet, and the augmentation-to-automation transition will follow reliability improvements per task class — not raw capability improvements.

### 11. The normative quality-over-quantity reframe ([[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai|Storoni 2026]])

The wiki's first explicitly **prescriptive** voice on the augmentation pole. Where the prior ten contributions are descriptive (what's happening) or strategic (where to deploy), [[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai|Storoni]] supplies the **definitional reframe of efficiency itself**: in the AI era, the productivity contribution of humans is no longer proportional to the *quantity* of their output (AI handles that) but to the *quality* of their output — the ideas, the judgment, the second- and third-order thinking AI does not (yet) reliably produce.

> "Our idea of efficiency really stems from the era of assembly line work, where the more products you assembled on an assembly line, the better your output was. ... But right now, we are going through a period of tremendous change in AI and in technology, and the productivity of a company is no longer proportional to the quantity of output of its human workers, because the realm of quantity is being taken over by AI and technology. Humans now influence the productivity of their organization by the quality of their output." — [[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai|Storoni]]

Storoni's contribution is **the neuroscience mechanism for the augmentation pole**:

- **Quality cognitive work requires gear-2** — the Goldilocks state on the norepinephrine inverted-U curve (sustained focus, alertness, nuance-detection, prefrontal-cortex engagement). Storoni's *gear 2* maps to the work that *cannot be substituted by AI* — judgment, second/third-order reasoning, learning under uncertainty.
- **Modern work design pushes workers into gear-3** (high-norepinephrine reactive state — Slack pressure, deadline panic, constant context-switching), where the prefrontal cortex disengages and humans produce *fast, low-quality, nuance-blind* output. *This is exactly the work AI does better.* So workers trapped in gear-3 are producing the kind of output that *gets automated next* — they have placed themselves on the automation side of the cut by their work pattern, not by their job category.
- **The augmentation prescription is therefore not a deployment choice, it is a work-design choice**: protect the windows that enable gear-2 (chronobiology-aware schedules, protected focus blocks, walking breaks, intrinsic-motivation structures), and let AI take the gear-3-reactive work that should never have been a human job in the first place.

Storoni's framing closes a gap in the concept's prior corpus: the augmentation-pole sources have shown *that* augmentation works (Brynjolfsson-Li-Raymond, Forsgren & Macvean, Anthropic Economic Index) and *where* to deploy it (Anand-Wu, MITTRI/Cisco) but not *what kind of cognitive work the human side of the augmentation pair has to be doing* for the pairing to actually produce value. Storoni's answer: **gear-2 quality work, in time-of-day-aware schedules, with intrinsic-motivation structures protecting the underlying cognitive states.**

Per the [[../../CLAUDE.md#lifecycle|Lifecycle confidence rules]] this single-source prescriptive-popularisation contribution does *not* lift the concept's confidence above the existing 0.95 cap; it expands the *scope* of what the augmentation pole covers (now including the work-design layer, not only the AI-deployment layer).

### 12. *Humans on judgment, agents on execution* + the anti-disposable-applications stance ([[2026-05-21-allen-aws-london-exec-forum-agentic-team-structures|Allen / AWS London Exec Forum, 21 May 2026]])

A second prescriptive voice on the augmentation pole — this time at AWS-vendor altitude. Allen's load-bearing principle (~27:24–27:30): ***"put humans on judgment work, agents on execution work."*** This is the concept page's tightest **division-of-labour heuristic** for the augmentation cut to date — narrower than the Anand-Wu task-quadrant grid and the MITTRI/Cisco replace-vs-give-agency framing, more operationally tractable than Storoni's gear-2-vs-gear-3 work-design lens, and directly compatible with both.

Paired with Allen's anti-disposable-applications stance (~5:24): *"software is going through the roof and beyond. We are getting to disposable applications. We do not want this as leaders, right?"* — the **failure mode of the augmentation pole** that mirrors Storoni's quality-over-quantity reframe. Allen names *Jevons paradox* as the underlying mechanism (cheaper software → more software → more disposable software) and the moats-erosion thesis as the strategic-altitude consequence. Brooklyn Solutions' customer-side ratification of the *human-starts-human-ends* operational pattern (Francis, ~40:13–40:54: *"we essentially always have a human start the work and a human end the work. But we may have agents of all different sorts in between"*) is the **vendor-customer-side compatible-with-regulation operationalisation** of the same principle for regulated-customer contexts (MoD, Danske Bank).

Convergent with [[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai|Storoni 2026]] on the prescriptive frame, with [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]] on the task-by-task deployment lens, with [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]] on the agency-with-oversight progression. Adds the AWS-vendor altitude to the augmentation-pole prescriptive cluster.

### 13. *Don't treat AI agents like employees* — the BCG/HBR anti-anthropomorphizing-framing finding ([[2026-05-06-kropp-bcg-hbr-dont-treat-ai-agents-like-employees|Kropp, Bedard, Wiles, Hsu, Krayer 2026]])

The wiki's first **RCT-grade empirical evidence on framing**: in a N=1,261 randomized experiment, the *AI-as-employee* framing (vs *AI-as-tool* framing, holding everything else constant) caused — among managers in orgs that already have AI on org charts — a 9pp drop in personal accountability, a 44% increase in escalation requests, 18% fewer errors caught, and (whole-sample) 13% higher uncertainty about professional identity. **The framing alone moves the augmentation-vs-automation interpretation** workers apply — when companies fail to distinguish augmentable from substitutable roles, *"employees are left to interpret AI solely as a substitute rather than a support, undermining trust and culture for all adopting populations"* ([[2026-05-06-kropp-bcg-hbr-dont-treat-ai-agents-like-employees|Kropp et al.]]). The article's prescription is to *make accountability explicit and personal for employees and agents* — decision rights, escalation triggers, consequences — rather than diffuse responsibility through anthropomorphizing language. Convergent with [[2026-05-21-allen-aws-london-exec-forum-agentic-team-structures|Allen's]] *"put humans on judgment work, agents on execution work"* + Brooklyn's *"human starts the work, human ends the work"* at the operational layer (15 days apart, independent vantages).

### 14. Augmentation is contingent on interaction-design, not guaranteed by deployment choice ([[2025-06-09-krakowski-human-centered-ai-field-experiment|Krakowski et al. 2025 (Management Science)]])

The wiki's first DiD-grade academic field experiment on the augmentation pole showing **untailored augmentation can produce *negative* performance vs the legacy IT control**. N=72 Nordic pharma sales experts; three conditions (legacy IT control / untailored AI / tailored AI tuned to Kirton 1976 cognitive style across four parameters — work procedure, decision authority, training, incentives). The *same* AI system is identical across conditions; only the interaction-design parameters differ. Result: tailored AI improves performance vs both control and untailored; **untailored AI gradually declines vs the stable legacy-IT baseline**. The qualitative interview evidence supplies the mechanism: a Danish innovator in the untailored condition: *"We got this super tool, and at the same time, I felt like in prison... this level of controlling killed my internal drive!"* Login-data mediation analysis shows utilization gradually decreases in the untailored condition and increases in the tailored condition — *rational adaptation, not algorithm aversion*. The wiki's strongest single-source empirical claim that **augmentation is contingent on interaction-design, not guaranteed by deployment choice**. Sharpens the [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson-Li-Raymond +15% finding]] (whose augmentation deployment was *explicitly designed* to augment — i.e. *tailored* in Krakowski's vocabulary) by supplying the contrast case where the design discipline was missing. Pairs with [[2026-04-28-dellacqua-jagged-technological-frontier|Dell'Acqua / Jagged Frontier]] (same INFORMS-journal family + same DiD/RCT method + same outside-the-frontier-loses pattern, with the bounded region being *task-shape* there and *interaction-design* here).

## The four-source convergence on the distinction

This allows us to keep human attention on the tasks we know agents can't yet perform, or where taste and judgement is really essential."* Engineering-leadership operationalisation of the augmentation pole — keep human attention on *judgement-bearing* work, delegate *task-execution* to agents. The talk also operationalises the **orchestrator-not-conductor** mental shift: *"a big mental model shift from being a Conductor of an individual agent to an Orchestrator of a system"* — multi-agent automation framed as augmentation-of-the-engineer's-judgement rather than agent-as-employee-replacement. Convergent with Narayanan's reliability-gating: the automation-trap-avoidance discipline is Narayanan's release-decision threshold applied per-task-class at fleet scale | "Avoid the automation trap"; "delegate tasks, not judgment"; "orchestrator of a system, not conductor of an individual agent" |
| [[2026-05-13-storoni-hbr-ideacast-redefining-efficiency-age-ai\|Storoni / HBR IdeaCast 2026]] | **The normative quality-over-quantity reframe** + **neuroscience mechanism for the augmentation pole**. *"The productivity of a company is no longer proportional to the quantity of output of its human workers, because the realm of quantity is being taken over by AI and technology. Humans now influence the productivity of their organization by the quality of their output."* Three-gear framework on the norepinephrine inverted-U curve: gear-2 is the cognitive state in which humans contribute the work AI cannot do; gear-3 reactive work is what AI does better and what gets automated next. Augmentation prescription becomes a **work-design** decision, not only a deployment decision: protect the gear-2 windows (chronobiology-aware schedules, focus blocks, intrinsic-motivation structures), let AI take the gear-3-reactive work. The wiki's first prescriptive voice from a neuroscience vantage on what the human side of the augmentation pair has to be doing | "Quality over quantity"; "three-gear framework"; "norepinephrine inverted-U"; "AI managers"; "work-design as augmentation prescription" |

When four independent sources arrive at the same cut from different angles (theory, strategy, vendor framing, and large-scale payroll data), the distinction is robust enough to be a load-bearing concept in the wiki.

## The Claude-channel customer-story cluster (Feb–May 2026)

A 2026 cluster of [[Anthropic|Anthropic]] Claude-channel customer-story videos supplies named-incumbent / named-platform practitioner anchors on both legs of the cut:

| Source | Pattern | Vantage |
|---|---|---|
| [[2026-02-18-lyft-customer-support-with-claude\|Lyft / Claude customer support (Feb 2026)]] | **Augment-and-reinvest-the-savings** — 87% resolution-time reduction; savings (*"millions of dollars"*) explicitly reinvested into upskilling agents (anti-burnout) plus a new high-touch programme (*Lyft Silver*). The 87% time saving did *not* translate into headcount reduction in this telling | named-incumbent contemporary practitioner anchor for the augmentation leg. Practitioner-side data point on the same phenomenon [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work\|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond (QJE 2025)]] measured at +15% RPH in a 2020–21 GPT-3 deployment — direction-of-effect consistent, scale of the practitioner-reported gain reinforces the QJE finding as a floor |
| [[2026-02-09-hubspot-customer-success-with-claude\|HubSpot / Claude customer success (Feb 2026)]] | **Augmentation as role-level scope expansion** — Claude turns a call transcript + knowledge-base articles into hospitality-revenue analysis the CSM then takes to the customer (*"that is something so far beyond my typical role as a CSM"*). Augmentation here *changes what the role does*, not just how fast it does it. Vendor-side 40% developer-productivity claim included as testimonial only | extension of the augmentation framing into customer success (not only customer support), with role-scope-expansion as the operational mechanism — complementary to [[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners\|Ransbotham's *augmented learners*]] and [[2026-05-05-nishar-nohria-end-of-one-size-fits-all\|Nishar/Nohria's *end of one-size-fits-all*]] |
| [[2026-05-13-jha-emergent-democratizing-app-building-with-claude\|Emergent / Jha-Ryan interview (May 2026)]] | **Full automation, replacement-of-the-outside-vendor** — Emergent users are *not* augmenting an existing dev team; they're replacing the dev-shop alternative. CEO names the comparison: *"a $250,000 price point that they would have paid if they had gone and and hired a dev shop"*. The user class is SMBs / domain experts who *never had software at all* (Christy in Alaska shipping *Equ*). $100M ARR in 8 months; 7M users in 190 countries; 70–80% never wrote a line of code | the **automation leg at scale for non-developers**. Distinct from enterprise-internal automation (where staff is augmented or displaced) — this is *SMB-replacement-of-an-outside-vendor-relationship-they-could-not-previously-afford*. Adds a previously-missing third deployment pattern to the wiki's cut: augmentation-of-staff, automation-of-staff, and *automation-as-substitution-for-an-outside-services-spend* |

The Lyft / HubSpot / Emergent triple is the wiki's first cluster on the automation/augmentation cut drawn entirely from *2026 named-incumbent practitioner self-reports* rather than third-party studies or vendor-CEO predictions. The two short-form videos (Lyft, HubSpot) are promotional and should not be cited as load-bearing on their own; the Emergent interview is substantive and load-bearing.

## Debates / contradictions

- **Is the cut binary or continuous?** Anthropic's Economic Index allows occupations to be classified as primarily-automative, primarily-augmentative, or mixed. In practice many AI uses sit on a continuum (e.g., a code assistant is augmentative when used for completion, automative when used for issue resolution). The dichotomy is useful for analysis but not always clean in the wild.
- **Does augmentation reliably *not* displace labor?** [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson 2025]]'s Fact 3 finds no displacement in augmentative uses *for young workers*. But long-run effects (productivity J-curve, demand elasticity, eventual task automation) might cause augmentative deployments to slide toward automation over time.
- **Augmentation can still concentrate gains.** The "equalizing effect" in [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]]'s productivity studies is at the worker level *within* a role. At the firm level, augmentation may still let the firm produce more with fewer workers — meaning the *individuals* who keep their jobs gain, but the *people who would have been hired* don't.
- **The cut is observable now via Claude conversations.** The Anthropic Economic Index methodology — sampling millions of Claude conversations and classifying each as automative/augmentative/none — is a novel measurement instrument. Its reliability depends on Claude's user base being representative of LLM usage broadly. Cross-validation with other LLM telemetry would strengthen the methodology.
