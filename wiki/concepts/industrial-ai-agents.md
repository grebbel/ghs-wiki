# Industrial AI Agents

The application class of [[ai-agents|AI agents]] deployed against **industrial / operational-technology (OT) environments** — manufacturing, process industries, energy, logistics — where the dominant problem is *semantic grounding of fragmented operational data* (MES, CMMS, QMS, ERP, SCADA), not *runtime engineering around a foundation model*. The vocabulary entered the wiki via [[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza 2026 (HiveMQ)]] (10 May 2026 ingest).

This page is a **stub** on a single source. Confidence is set defensively at `0.70`. Future ingests on Industry 4.0, OT cybersecurity, manufacturing AI case studies, or knowledge-graph implementations will substantiate or reshape it.

## Working definition

**Industrial AI agents** are agentic systems whose primary operating environment is the OT/IT-converged data fabric of an industrial enterprise — equipment, processes, materials, work orders, certifications, defects — and whose decisions (scheduling production, monitoring quality, planning maintenance, orchestrating logistics) carry physical consequences. Three properties distinguish them from the SaaS / coding-agent cluster the wiki has previously documented:

1. **Data-fabric primacy**: the dominant engineering problem is reconciling and semantically grounding data across fragmented operational systems, not assembling prompts and tools around a foundation model.
2. **Action-precondition governance**: actions can have safety and physical consequences, so the governance layer must encode preconditions / validation rules / state-change semantics *in the data layer itself* (action types in the ontology), not just as runtime guardrails.
3. **Continuous real-time data dependency**: the semantic layer would *quickly become stale* without a real-time distributed data foundation (per [[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza]]: edge gateways, MQTT data plane, streaming governance). The agent's *situational awareness* depends on the data fabric staying current.

## What an industrial-AI-agent stack looks like ([[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza 2026]])

Manditereza's HiveMQ white paper presents a **three-layer architecture** that maps onto the wiki's existing [[agent-harness|harness]] vocabulary at the top, but adds two layers underneath:

| Layer | What lives here | Wiki vocabulary |
|---|---|---|
| **Agentic AI** (top) | Agent runtime, agent studio, agent template marketplace, agent orchestration & governance, operational safety & oversight | [[agent-harness]] in industrial vocabulary |
| **Data Intelligence** (middle) | Discovery & cataloging, governance, semantic modeling + Unified Namespace, event/anomaly detection, real-time computation | New: the *semantic-data layer* |
| **Data Streaming** (bottom) | Edge gateways, MQTT data plane, streaming data governance, bidirectional bridging, enterprise security & access control, enterprise integration | New: the *operational data substrate* |

The Data Intelligence layer is where the **ontology** lives — the semantic foundation that makes the Agentic AI layer's agents able to reason reliably.

## The four structural pillars of an industrial ontology

Per [[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza 2026]]:

1. **Object Types** — categories of entities (Machine, Operator, Work Order, Material Batch, Quality Inspection). Both physical and abstract.
2. **Properties** — characteristics. Static (Serial Number, Location), dynamic (Status, Temperature), or **computed** (OEE Score, Predicted Failure Date — derived via calculations or ML models).
3. **Link Types** — relationships ("Operator operates Machine," "Production Run runs on Machine," "Quality Check validates Batch"). Links can carry properties (e.g. *qualified-for* relationship may include certification date and expiration).
4. **Action Types** — operations (Start Production Run, Complete Quality Check, Schedule Maintenance) with **preconditions** that must be met and **state changes** that result. *"This transforms the ontology from a passive data model into an operational framework."*

Action types are the load-bearing innovation here for *governance*: an industrial AI agent can only take actions the ontology *permits*, against entities it *has access to*, when preconditions are *satisfied*. This **embedded data-layer governance** is distinct from (and complements) the per-tool runtime guardrails [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee]] documents for SaaS agents.

## Why ontologies matter for agentic AI in this domain

[[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza]] names five mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Why it matters here |
|---|---|
| **Unified operational awareness** | Reconciles MES (production) / CMMS (maintenance) / QMS (quality) / ERP (planning) / SCADA (process control) across system boundaries |
| **Semantic layer** | Natural-language queries become *precise traversals* through the knowledge graph — *"without semantic grounding, agents must guess at meaning, and guessing produces hallucinations"* |
| **Compounding returns** | Ontology investment is one-time; every subsequent agent benefits from the full structure (instant access to equipment capabilities, operator certifications, material availability, maintenance constraints) |
| **Closed-loop learning** | Action types + relationship tracking automatically connect decisions to outcomes; the chain remains traversable for retrospective analysis |
| **Governed autonomy** | Action types' preconditions / validation rules / relationship scope define what agents *can* do — *"this embedded governance enables autonomy within controlled boundaries, essential for industrial environments where uncontrolled actions carry real consequences"* |

## Ontology vs. relational data model

> *"Traditional databases store records; ontologies model operational reality. A database table for equipment contains rows of attributes. An ontology defines what 'equipment' means, how equipment relates to production, maintenance, and personnel, and what operations equipment can undergo. The ontology captures semantics, meaning, not just data. This distinction becomes critical for AI agents."* — [[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza 2026]]

The implementation form is typically a **knowledge graph** — entities as nodes, relationships as edges. The graph structure naturally represents interconnected industrial operations and enables efficient traversal queries.

## Where this fits in the wider wiki

The industrial-AI thread sits **adjacent to but distinct from** the agent-harness / coding-agent / agentic-engineering cluster that has dominated the wiki's recent intake. The constructs partly overlap:

- **Knowledge graph** as agentic memory substrate appears both here ([[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza]] for industrial reasoning) and in personal-developer-memory ([[2026-05-08-bratanic-unified-agentic-memory-hooks|Bratanic]]). Different audiences, same data structure. The convergence is not coincidental.
- **Embedded governance via action preconditions** (industrial) vs. **runtime governance via per-tool guardrails** ([[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee's]] Constraints layer in SaaS agents) name the same problem at different layers — a genuine variation worth tracking.
- **Compounding returns** (industrial: semantic-model investment pays off across all agents; SaaS: harness configuration pays off across all customers) are operationally identical claims about the *durable* asset of agentic systems.

## Adjacent wiki concepts and sources

- [[ai-agents]] — the parent application class.
- [[agent-harness]] — the runtime layer industrial agents still need; the *Agentic AI Layer* in Manditereza's three-tier architecture.
- [[2026-04-28-gomaa-lean-4-0|Gomaa 2026]] — addresses Industry 4.0 / lean manufacturing as a transformation lens; the data-architecture substrate Manditereza describes is what those transformations consume.
- [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|Mittri 2026]] — *AI-enabled enterprise* is the broader frame; this concept is OT-specific.
- [[2026-04-28-warner-wager-dynamic-capabilities-digital-transformation|Warner & Wäger 2018]] — *digital transformation dynamic capabilities*; the data-foundation dimension is operationalized by the kind of semantic layer Manditereza describes.
- [[industry-4-0]] — the industrial transformation umbrella.
- [[lean-4-0]] — lean operating principles applied to digital transformation.

## Candidate sub-concepts (single-source for now; promote on second mention)

- **Ontology / Semantic Data Layer** — the three-tier model (semantic model + domain ontologies + knowledge graph). Defer to second-source mention; the broader knowledge-representation literature would substantiate it instantly but is not yet ingested.
- **Unified Namespace (UNS)** — named here as the data-streaming substrate addressing fragmentation at the data layer; not yet substantiated independently.
- **Knowledge graph** — **promoted to [[knowledge-graphs]] concept page on 12 May 2026** after four-source threshold met ([[2026-02-01-manditereza-ontology-driven-industrial-ai|Manditereza]] industrial-OT + [[2026-05-08-bratanic-unified-agentic-memory-hooks|Bratanic]] agentic-memory + [[2026-04-27-surrealdb-knowledge-graphs-for-ai-agents-practical-guide|SurrealDB]] practical-engineering + [[2023-12-07-leskovec-stanford-cs224w-knowledge-graph-embeddings|Leskovec]] academic-foundation). The wiki's KG-substrate cluster is now anchored at the concept layer. The KG-as-industrial-substrate framing this page describes is one of four named vantages on the construct.
- **Action types / action-precondition governance** — single-source for now; distinct enough from runtime guardrails to track separately.

## Open questions

- **Cross-vendor ontology standards.** The white paper is framework-agnostic on ontology language (OWL, RDF, SHACL, GraphQL, property graph) — but production-deployment specifics would need a follow-up source.
- **Ontology evolution under operational change.** Industrial environments change (new machines, retired lines, modified processes) — versioning, migration, schema-drift handling are unaddressed.
- **Outcome measurement.** The white paper names six customers (Audi, BMW, Eli Lilly, Liberty Global, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens) but presents no quantitative case studies or before/after benchmarks.
- **Foundation-model integration.** How an ontology-grounded agent integrates with foundation-model reasoning in practice (MCP tool? generated tool wrapper? embedding ontology fragment in system prompt?) is unaddressed.
- **Cross-pollination with the harness thread.** The two threads (industrial-data-fabric and harness-runtime) currently sit beside each other without shared vocabulary. Whether they converge — or whether industrial AI develops a parallel discipline — is open.
