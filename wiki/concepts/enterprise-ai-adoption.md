# Enterprise AI Adoption

The pace, depth, and pattern by which organizations integrate AI into their business functions, processes, and products. The dominant 2024 signal is a **step-change in adoption breadth**, especially for [[generative-ai]], paired with **modest realized financial impact** and very low maturity.

## Working definition

Multiple complementary lenses are used by sources in this wiki:

**Breadth lens** ([[McKinsey & Company]] / [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index]]): an organization is "using AI" if it deploys AI in **at least one business function**. Low bar — captures adoption breadth, not depth.

**Stage lens** ([[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR / MIT Sloan]]): organizations are placed on a **four-stage AI maturity ladder** — from "Experiment and prepare" to "Become AI future-ready" — based on a 0–100% Total AI Effectiveness score combining operations, customer experience, and ecosystem-support effectiveness.

**Readiness lens** ([[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]): only **13% of companies globally are ready** to leverage AI to its full potential. Two-thirds (68%) say their infrastructure is at best moderately ready. **98% feel increased urgency** over the past year, **85% give themselves <18 months** to deploy a strategy.

**Capabilities lens** ([[2026-04-28-warner-wager-dynamic-capabilities-digital-transformation|Warner & Wäger 2019]]): adoption is the result of a system of **digital sensing / digital seizing / digital transforming** dynamic capabilities — nine microfoundations including digital scouting, scenario planning, mindset crafting, rapid prototyping, portfolio balancing, strategic agility, ecosystem navigation, structural redesign, and digital-maturity improvement. See [[dynamic-capabilities]].

**Foresight lens** ([[2026-04-28-webb-strategic-foresight|Webb 2024]] / [[2026-04-28-ftsg-convergence-outlook-2026|FTSG 2026]]): adoption decisions sit downstream of strategic foresight — the disciplined process of signal detection → trend identification → scenarios → strategy. See [[strategic-foresight]].

**2026 numbers** ([[2026-04-30-ai-index-report-2026|AI Index 2026]] Top Takeaway #1, #9):
- **Organizational adoption: 88%** (up from 78% in 2024).
- **Generative AI population adoption: 53% within three years** — faster than the PC or the internet.
- **Productivity gains: 14–26%** in customer support and software development; weaker or *negative* effects in tasks requiring more judgment.
- **AI agent deployment remains in single digits** across nearly all business functions — adoption breadth is high but agent-mediated workflow depth is still nascent.
- **>80% of U.S. high school and college students** use AI for school-related tasks; only **half** of middle/high schools have AI policies and just **6% of teachers** say those policies are clear — adoption is outrunning policy.

**Transformation lens** ([[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Dutt, Chatterji et al. 2026]]):
- The **[[micro-productivity-trap]]** — task-level gains failing to translate to firm-level results — is a named diagnostic for the gap between 88% organizational adoption and single-digit agent-mediated workflow depth.
- Two failure modes: **offering lock-in** (AI optimizes existing offerings without reframing value) and **process lock-in** (AI automates current processes without redesigning them).
- Empirical anchor: **10–25% EBITDA gains** across [[Bain & Company]] clients adopting a transformation-mindset four-step framework (narrow possibilities strategically; reimagine workflows; engage those closest to the process; measure what matters with concrete business outcomes plus continuous **evals**).
- Worked cases: **[[Lowe's]]** + [[OpenAI]] partnership (Mylow / Mylow Companion across 1,700+ stores; >2× online conversion; +200bps CSAT in-aisle); **FabricationCo** (~$30M additional profit on track; 15× faster quote generation; +10pp win rate in 3 months).

**Six-capability lens — McKinsey "Rewired"** ([[2026-05-03-rewired-second-edition-sample|Lamarre, Smaje, Levin et al. 2026, 2nd ed]]):
- **Definition**: "the process of developing organizational and technology-based capabilities that allow a company to continuously improve its customer experience and lower its unit costs; and over time sustain a competitive advantage."
- **Six capabilities** that companies must be strong across to win (Exhibit I.1):
  1. **Business-led roadmap** — top-down aspiration, alignment on economic leverage points, reimagination of business domains
  2. **Talent** — upskilled business leaders + density of engineering talent
  3. **Operating model** — business, tech, and operations closer together
  4. **Technology** — modern software engineering and platforms for reuse and time-to-value
  5. **Data** — unified, easy-to-consume data
  6. **Adoption and scaling** — change management; end-to-end process reconfiguration; impact measured in business KPIs
- **Empirical anchor** (~20 AI-leader deep-dive companies): **20% EBITDA uplift** on average, **1–2 year breakeven**, **$3 of incremental EBITDA per $1 invested**, with focus on **1–3 business domains**.
- **70% talent-density shifts**: 70%+ in-house, 70%+ "doer" engineers, 70%+ at competent-or-expert skill levels.
- "We don't have a single success story where senior business leaders were not in the driver's seat."
- Note: McKinsey is a recurring data partner of the [[AI Index]]; the McKinsey Global AI Survey is the instrument behind several AI-adoption headline numbers in the wiki. The 20% EBITDA range is from McKinsey client work — vendor-of-deployment data — but is consistent in magnitude with independent ranges from the [[2026-04-30-ai-index-report-2026|AI Index 2026]] (14–26% productivity gains in customer support / software dev) and [[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Bain/OpenAI 2026]] (10–25% EBITDA).

**Org-design lens** ([[2026-04-28-werner-lebrun-octopus-organization|Werner-Le-Brun]]): organizations are either **Tin Man Orgs** (predictability-optimized for a complicated world) or **Octopus Orgs** (adaptive, distributed, customer-centric for a complex world). **Just 12% of transformation efforts** show sustainable performance gains.

**Task lens** ([[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]]): a 2×2 matrix on **cost of errors × type of knowledge** decides where to deploy GenAI on a per-task basis (no regrets / creative catalyst / quality control / human-first zones).

**Firm-boundary lens — four models** ([[2026-05-05-nishar-nohria-end-of-one-size-fits-all|Nishar & Nohria 2026]]): a sharper reframing of the build-vs-buy decision under [[generative-ai]]. The economic logic that made standardized SaaS the only practical default is **dissolving** — custom software is accessible again because foundation-model + vibe-coding tools (Cursor, Replit Agent, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) compress months-of-engineering into days. The strategic question shifts from "which tools to buy?" to **"which workflows do we own?"** Four emerging answers, not mutually exclusive:
- **Build** — directly on foundation models, for distinctive jobs (e.g., a logistics company building a system that continuously optimizes delivery time and cost based on its own data — over time becomes hard-to-replicate institutional knowledge).
- **Compose** — vendor scaffolding and templates configured by business users (e.g., **Salesforce Headless 360** for tailoring lead scoring and outreach to a specific sales motion without building a CRM from scratch). Direction reverses: software adapts to the company.
- **Collaborate** — providers' forward-deployed engineers build bespoke systems in weeks rather than the months/years of a traditional ERP deployment. Speed and alignment in exchange for external dependency.
- **Buy outcomes** — procure the outcome itself, not the tool. Adobe's 2026 outcome-based pricing for its CX Enterprise / agentic AI tools is the named industry signal: Adobe deploys agents directly with the customer and charges for outcomes (e.g., successful ad campaigns) rather than per seat or per token.
- **Empirical anchors:** enterprise GenAI app spending **$1.7B (2023) → $37B (2025)** (~22× in 2 years; SaaS took ~10 years for comparable penetration); **40% of code AI-generated**; **>1/3 of companies** have replaced ≥1 SaaS tool with a custom GenAI alternative; public SaaS valuations **30–60% below 2021 peaks**.
- **Strategic implication:** "the boundary of the firm becomes a variable rather than a given." Reinforces the [[micro-productivity-trap]] thesis from [[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Dutt, Chatterji et al.]] — **data architecture and process redesign are load-bearing**, not afterthoughts. Caveat from the article: "moving quickly is not the same as moving effectively."

**Organizational-learning lens — Augmented Learners** ([[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham et al. 2024]] + [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026]]): an MIT SMR × BCG 2×2 distinguishing organizations by how they combine **organizational learning** (test-and-learn, postmortem culture, learning codification, knowledge sharing) with **AI-specific learning** (using AI for new learning + performance + human feedback loops + employee learning from AI).
- **Distribution** (3,467-respondent global survey, spring 2024): **Limited Learners 59%**, Organizational Learners 14%, AI-specific Learners 12%, **Augmented Learners 15%**.
- **Headline outcomes**: Augmented Learners are **1.6×** more likely to feel prepared for industry uncertainty than Limited Learners; **2.2×** for talent disruptions, **1.8×** for technology disruptions, **1.6×** for legal/regulatory disruptions. **99%** of Augmented Learners report annualized revenue benefits from AI vs **71%** of Limited Learners (1.4× multiplier).
- **Project-selection signature**: Augmented Learners are **1.9×** more likely to invest in long-term (>5-year) AI projects and **2.4×** more likely to invest in high-risk projects — they treat AI as a *learning substrate*, not just an efficiency tool.
- **The operational mechanism** ([[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron-Schrage 2026]]) — extending the empirical finding 17 months later, the column specifies a **three-step flywheel** that turns the 15% advantage into compounding returns: **Verification** (does this output meet the standard? — binary check against existing criteria) → **Evaluation** (what does this output reveal? — generates new standards; requires domain expertise) → **Learning capture** (how do we ensure this insight persists? — version control for organizational judgment, e.g. CLAUDE.md-style files). When any step is missing, organizations *consume* AI outputs rather than *compound* benefits from them.
- **Why this lens is distinct** from Anand-Wu's task lens or MIT CISR's stage lens: the Augmented Learner construct is **about how the organization metabolizes AI interactions**, not where it deploys AI or what stage of maturity it has reached. A Stage 2 firm with a learning culture can be on the Augmented Learner trajectory; a Stage 4 firm without one cannot. The combinatorial 2×2 cuts across maturity stages.
- **Empirical claim about strategy**: orgs reporting an AI strategy are **2× more likely** to generate additional business value; orgs with AI core to strategy are **2.6× more likely**. *But*: only **39%** report having an AI strategy in 2024 — back to 2017 levels (down from 59% in 2020), as GenAI's emergence forced strategy reformulation.
- **Operational claim** (Kiron-Schrage): orgs that build systematic feedback loops between humans and AI are **6× more likely** to derive substantial financial benefits; orgs investing in learning with AI are **73% more likely** to achieve significant financial impact.

**Human-reaction lens — resistance as data** ([[2026-05-07-carucci-resistance-as-data|Carucci 2026]]): a practitioner framework for interpreting how *people* respond to deployments. All resistance is meaningful data; the leader's job isn't to determine whether pushback is valid but to diagnose what it's signalling. Three traps when leaders misread resistance (personalize / moralize / rush to resolution) and four signal categories (Loss / Anxiety / Lack of control / Flaws in change). Operationalizes the *human-side* mechanics of MIT CISR's "Synchronization" pillar and Werner-Le-Brun's Octopus principles ("make changes WITH people, not TO them"). Distinct decision layer from the deployment frameworks above — the question shifts from "what should we deploy?" to "what is the team's reaction telling us about whether what we deployed is working?" See [[micro-productivity-trap]] for how Carucci's category #4 (Flaws in change) aligns with the operators-see-problems-leaders-dismiss pattern.

**Runtime-engineering lens — agent harnesses as the new moat** ([[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]] + [[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]]): a 10th lens at the engineering-stack level — see the dedicated subsection below for the full treatment. Headline: **the model is rented and converging to commodity; the [[agent-harness|harness]] is owned and compounds.** Plan for model swap, not marriage. Build Constraints before cleverness. Hire systems engineers, not AI specialists.

All ten lenses agree qualitatively: **most organizations are using AI in some form, but very few are actually mature/ready/adapted.** The AI Index pegs "mature" at 1%; MIT CISR pegs Stage 4 at 7%; Cisco pegs "ready" at 13%; Ransbotham et al. peg Augmented Learners at 15%; Werner-Le-Brun's 12% transformation-success baseline gives the broader org-change context. The convergence of *seven independent measurements all clustering around 7-15% upper-tail* is the wiki's strongest evidence that the high-value-from-AI cohort is structurally narrow, not measurement-artefactual. See [[ai-maturity-measurement-comparison]] for methodological cross-walk and [[syntheses/organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption|organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption]] for the framework comparison (the Nishar-Nohria firm-boundary lens, the Carucci human-reaction lens, the Ransbotham/Kiron organizational-learning lens, and now the agent-harness runtime-engineering lens are the **7th through 10th** named frameworks; see the synthesis for the running cluster).

The shape of adoption can be measured along several dimensions:

- **Breadth:** how many functions, regions, industries are using AI at all.
- **Depth (maturity):** how integrated and value-generating those uses are.
- **Use-case mix:** which functions and tasks are AI applied to.
- **Financial impact:** measured cost savings and revenue gains by function.
- **Workforce impact:** productivity, headcount expectations, reskilling needs.

## The MIT CISR Four Stages of Enterprise AI Maturity

A stage-based progression model from [[Stephanie Woerner]], [[Peter Weill]], Ina Sebastian, and Evgeny Káganer at [[MIT CISR]]. Distribution is from the MIT CISR 2022 Future Ready Survey (N=721) — note the 2022 baseline predates the GenAI explosion, so current distributions may differ.

| Stage | Name | % (2022) | Defining attributes | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Experiment and prepare | 28% | Workforce education; acceptable-use policies; data accessibility; humans-in-the-loop | Exploration and education |
| 2 | Build pilots and capabilities | 34% | Process simplification & automation begun; use cases; APIs; LLMs (out-of-box + GenAI) augmenting work | Business cases and pilots |
| 3 | Develop AI ways of working | 31% | Expanded automation; test-and-learn; architected for reuse; pretrained + proprietary models; autonomous agents | Scaling AI platforms and dashboards |
| 4 | Become AI future-ready | **7%** | AI embedded in decision-making and processes; selling AI-augmented services; combining traditional + generative + agentic + robotic AI | Continuous innovation, new revenue streams |

**The financial inflection is the Stage 2 → Stage 3 transition.** Stages 1–2 firms had financial performance below industry average; Stages 3–4 firms above. Source: [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT Sloan article]].

### The "Four S" challenges to scale Stage 2 → Stage 3

To make the leap from pilots (Stage 2) to embedded AI ways of working (Stage 3), MIT CISR identifies four organizational challenges:

1. **Strategy** — Align AI investments with strategic goals; offer measurable, scalable value.
2. **Systems** — Architect modular, interoperable platforms and data ecosystems for enterprise-wide intelligence.
3. **Synchronization** — Create AI-ready people, roles, and teams; redesign work around AI capabilities.
4. **Stewardship** — Embed and monitor compliant, human-centered, and transparent AI practices by design — see [[responsible-ai]].

Driving the change requires a **united front among the CEO, CIO, chief strategy officer, and head of HR** — not a single function's effort.

### Worked examples

- **[[Guardian Life Insurance]]** (regulated US insurance, [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT Sloan]]): Automated RFP and quoting process — turnaround **1 week → 24 hours**. Embedded compliance/legal in architecture review boards. Reskilling into AI-focused roles.
- **[[Italgas]]** (Europe's largest natural gas distributor, [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT Sloan]]): "Digital Factory" innovation hub since 2017; **300TB data platform, 23 AI models**; WorkOnSite (+40% construction speed, -80% inspections); DANA (GenAI network control); 30,000 hours of AI training in 2024; **commercialized WorkOnSite for €3M revenue in 2024**.
- **[[Ford]]** (manufacturing, [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]): AI-augmented vision systems for assembly inspection — defects on "squish tube" rubber seals dropped from **63 per month to zero**. Computational fluid dynamic test for vehicle airflow: **15 hours → 10 seconds** with AI prediction.

## The Anand-Wu 2×2 task framework

A complementary task-level lens from [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand & Wu (2025)]]. Maps each enterprise task onto two axes:

- **Cost of errors**: low (small inefficiencies in a draft) ↔ high (reputational damage, legal liability, physical harm)
- **Type of knowledge**: explicit data (structured/unstructured but capturable) ↔ tacit knowledge (experiential, intuitive, context-specific)

| | Tacit knowledge | Explicit data |
|---|---|---|
| **High cost of errors** | **Human-first zone** — Human leads, AI assists with minor tasks. Setting strategy, integrating enterprise systems, disciplinary decisions, hiring critical employees. | **Quality control zone** — AI produces, human verifies. Drafting high-value contracts ([[Harvey]]); writing production software code ([[GitHub Copilot]]); due diligence. |
| **Low cost of errors** | **Creative catalyst zone** — AI creates options, human selects. Creating advertisements, outlining sales scripts, developing products. | **No regrets zone** — AI does it all (no human in the loop). Bulk customer inquiries, document summarization, résumé screening. *Where [[ai-agents]] thrive.* |

The framework's punchline: stop debating GenAI's intelligence; ask which tasks GenAI can assist with today to make human judgment more effective. See [[syntheses/organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption|organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption]] for how this maps to other frameworks.

## Why don't gen AI gains show up in P&L? (Anand-Wu's leakage diagnostic)

[[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]]'s most actionable artifact: six leakage points along the value chain where potential gains evaporate before reaching the P&L.

| # | Leakage point | What goes wrong | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Task efficiency** | Fail to identify tasks where gen AI improves efficiency | Everyone, enabled by CTO/CIO |
| 2 | **Employee adoption** | Miss opportunities because employees aren't trained | Everyone, enabled by CTO/CIO |
| 3 | **Resource redeployment** | Labor capacity saved isn't redeployed to higher-value tasks | Every manager, enabled by CEO/COO |
| 4 | **Organizational throughput** | Fail to redesign processes to capitalize on gains | Every manager, enabled by CEO/COO |
| 5 | **Market demand** | Customers don't have a need to purchase the greater output | CEO + C-suite |
| 6 | **Competitive retention** | Competitors use gen AI similarly; gains dissipated through lower margins | CEO + C-suite |

This is the wiki's sharpest answer to the [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] puzzle: *why is adoption 78% but maturity 1%?* Because gains are leaking at multiple points, and only diagnosing the leakage at every step gets ROI to the bottom line.

## The paradox of access (Anand-Wu)

A counterweight to the "AI is a competitive moat" rhetoric: **"Because everyone can use it, it becomes dramatically harder to capture value with it."** Pattern from prior tech cycles:

- E-ticketing (2000s): all airlines adopted; benefits flowed to customers as lower airfare.
- CAD/ERP (1990s+): once an advantage, became table stakes.
- Big Law (1990s+): clients pulled work in-house using digital tools; nearly **90% of large law firms now offer flat-fee or favorable pricing**; in-house counsel tripled 1997–2020.

Implication: **competitive differentiation in 2025+ comes from complementary assets** — proprietary data, unique people/processes/culture — not from "having AI." See [[syntheses/organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption|organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption]].

## Key claims

### The 2024 jump (breadth)

- **78% of orgs use AI in at least one function** in 2024 (vs. 55% in 2023; ~50% during 2017–2022). Source: [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §4.4.1, citing McKinsey survey n=2,854.
- **71% use [[generative-ai|generative AI]]** in at least one function (vs. 33% in 2023). The use-gap between any-AI and GenAI shrunk from 22pp to 7pp in a single year.
- The rise was global. Regional 2024 adoption: NA 82% (+21pp YoY), Europe 80% (+23pp), Greater China 75% (+27pp — largest jump), Developing markets 77% (+28pp), Asia-Pacific 72% (+14pp). [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §4.4.4.

### Maturity is rare (depth)

- **Only 1% of C-suite executives** describe their GenAI rollouts as "mature" — McKinsey complementary survey of developed-markets execs, via [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §4.4.5.
- Most companies report cost savings of **<10% per function** and revenue gains of **<5%**. The financial impact is real but small at typical adoption depth.

### Use-case mix

| Function | AI use rate (Tech industry, 2024) |
|---|---|
| IT | 48% |
| Marketing & sales | 47% |
| Product/service development | 47% |
| Software engineering | 45% |
| Service operations | 42% |
| HR | 24% |

Industries by overall AI use (decreasing): **Technology > Media/telecom > Financial services > Energy/materials > Health care > Consumer goods > Advanced industries > Business services**. Source: [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §4.4.2.

**Top GenAI use cases:** marketing strategy content (27%), knowledge management (19%), personalization (19%), design (14%), code creation (13%), automation of sales follow-up (13%), customer-service workflow integration (12%), sales lead identification (11%), accelerated R&D simulation (11%), scientific literature review (11%). [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] Fig 4.4.5.

### Financial impact by function

Most companies that report any financial impact estimate it as modest. Cost savings <10% is the most common bucket; revenue gains <5% is the most common bucket.

| Function | Report cost savings (analytical / GenAI) | Report revenue gains (analytical / GenAI) |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing & sales | 34% / 47% | **71% / 66%** |
| Service operations | **49% / 58%** | 57% / 63% |
| Supply chain & inventory | 43% / **61%** | 63% / **67%** |
| Software engineering | 41% / 52% | 44% / 57% |
| Strategy & corporate finance | — / 56% | — / **70%** |
| HR | 37% / 56% | — |
| Product/service dev | 23% / 43% | 56% / 51% |

### Productivity (consistent equalizing effect at task level)

Five rigorous empirical studies (n>200,000 across customer support, software, materials science, knowledge work) converge on **AI productivity gains in the 10–45% range**, with a robust **equalizing effect** — low-skill workers benefit more.

| Study | Task | Low-skill gain | High-skill gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work\|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond 2025 (QJE)]]** | Customer support | **30%** RPH; quality up | **~0% RPH; quality DOWN slightly** |
| Dell'Acqua et al. 2023 | Consulting | 43.0% | 16.5% |
| Cui et al. 2024 | Software engineering | 21–40% | 7–16% |
| Hoffman et al. 2024 | Software engineering | 12–27% | 5–10% |

Plus: Microsoft workplace study, Toner-Rodgers 2025 (materials scientists, +44.1% discovery / +39.4% patents / +17.2% prototypes). Sources: [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §4.4 and (for the customer-support study) the primary source [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond 2025 QJE]].

**Important refinement (primary-source upgrade):** The Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond customer-support study, in its Quarterly Journal of Economics version, reports the headline as **+15% RPH overall**, not the +14.2% from the NBER working paper version that was cited via the AI Index. **More importantly**: the equalizing effect is not "high-skill workers gain 0%" — it's "high-skill workers see *small speed gains AND a small DECLINE in quality* of their conversations." This nuance is load-bearing for [[automation-vs-augmentation]]: augmentation is positive overall and reliably equalizing for low-skill workers, but **not strictly Pareto-improving** at the top — and the long-run training-data quality of the AI system depends on top performers continuing to make original contributions, which the paper finds is being diluted.

**Important caveat (added 2026-04-28 batch):** the equalizing effect is measured at the **task level within a role**, not at the **occupation level across firms**. As [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson, Chandar & Chen (2025)]] show using ADP payroll data, *employment* for early-career workers in highly AI-exposed occupations has declined ~13% relative since late 2022 — even as productivity per worker has risen. Both findings are true: AI raises individual productivity (especially for low-skill workers) *and* reduces the number of workers needed in automate-able roles. See [[ai-employment-effects]] and [[automation-vs-augmentation]].

### Workforce expectations (mixed and softening)

McKinsey survey, via [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] Fig 4.4.13:
- **31%** of orgs expect little change in workforce size over 3 years.
- **43%** expect workforce decreases (8% by >20%, 14% by 11–20%, 21% by 3–10%).
- **23%** expect workforce increases.
- **The share predicting workforce reductions has declined YoY.** Business leaders are becoming less convinced AI will shrink workforces in the near term.
- **46% expect >20% of the workforce to need reskilling.**

### Realized employment outcomes (Brynjolfsson et al. 2025)

[[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson, Chandar & Chen (2025)]] use ADP payroll data covering ~25M U.S. workers (Jan 2021 – July 2025) to test whether AI is yet displacing human labor. The empirical correlate of the McKinsey expectations:

- **Early-career workers (ages 22–25) in the most AI-exposed occupations: ~13% relative decline** in employment since late 2022 (firm-time-effects-controlled).
- Software developers ages 22–25: nearly **20%** decline from peak in late 2022.
- Older workers in same occupations: stable or growing.
- Concentrated in **automation** uses (not augmentation) — see [[automation-vs-augmentation]].
- Adjustments visible in **employment, not wages** (wage stickiness).
- The McKinsey expectation that AI may not shrink overall headcount is *roughly* consistent with the Brynjolfsson finding that overall employment continues to grow — but with a critical compositional twist: the decreases are concentrated at the **entry level**, not spread evenly across all roles.

This is the wiki's first **measurable empirical evidence** for AI labor displacement, distinct from survey data on expectations. See [[ai-employment-effects]].

### Integration depth correlates with productivity payoff

Necula et al. 2024 (Romanian survey, n=233): organizations with high AI integration showed a **72% probability of significant productivity improvements** vs. **3.4%** for those with minimal integration.

### The runtime-engineering lens: agent harnesses as the new moat ([[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]] + [[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]])

A 10th lens on enterprise AI adoption emerges from the practitioner literature on [[agent-harness|agent harnesses]] (April–May 2026). The vantage is *engineering-level* — sitting beneath the strategy/maturity/transformation frameworks above — and offers a sharp prescription that complements [[2026-05-05-nishar-nohria-end-of-one-size-fits-all|Nishar-Nohria's]] firm-boundary lens:

- **"Plan for swap, not for marriage."** Foundation models are converging to commodity status. The decision still matters, but the moat it produces lasts months, not years. Keep the agent harness model-agnostic where reasonable.
- **The harness investment is a permanent allocation, not a phase.** Build Context / Constraints / Contracts in year 1; build the Compounding (self-tuning telemetry → harness adjustment) layer in year 2; calibrate every quarter after. *"This is the work."*
- **Sequence matters: build constraints before you build cleverness.** The Friday-in-March story (an agent emptied a customer's workspace because no intent-validation existed) repeats itself in every AI product without a hook layer. *"It is cheaper to build the layer than to write the apology emails."*
- **The under-resourced role**: an engineer who thinks about agents the way SREs think about distributed systems — failure modes, observability, graceful degradation, long-tail edge cases. Not a model researcher, not a prompt engineer.

Where the [[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham/Kiron Augmented Learners]] lens measures *organizational learning capability* (the 9th lens above), the agent-harness lens measures *runtime engineering maturity*. They are complementary, not redundant: an org can have strong organizational learning culture *and* a weak harness layer (or vice versa), and AI products require both.

**Critical caveat from [[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]]**: ~90% of the harness work is *mature systems engineering applied to a new substrate.* If your engineering team has shipped real backend systems, *"you're already 80% of the way there."* The remaining 10% (non-determinism at the execution layer + context as a degrading resource) is where the genuine new design discipline lives. **Implication for hiring**: don't hire AI specialists for harness work — hire systems engineers and let them ramp on the 10%.

### The Augmented Learner advantage and its operational machinery ([[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham et al. 2024]] + [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026]])

The **eighth annual** MIT SMR × BCG global survey (3,467 respondents) finds that Augmented Learners — orgs combining high organizational learning capability with high AI-specific learning capability — represent only **15%** of the sample but realize 1.4–2.2× advantages on uncertainty management and revenue capture. The follow-up Kiron-Schrage 2026 column then specifies the operational mechanism (**verification → evaluation → learning capture**) that turns the 15% finding into a deployable playbook.

**Three areas where AI augments organizational learning** (Ransbotham et al. operational core):

| Area | Mechanism | Worked examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge capture** | AI extracts tacit knowledge resistant to legacy codification | NASA Mars 2020 (rover learns "interesting" terrain without explicit definition); LG Nova AR glasses (real-time tacit-knowledge extraction from factory workers); Capital One (Prem Natarajan, test-and-learn approach) |
| **Knowledge synthesis** | AI systematizes data overwhelming legacy analytics | Stitch Fix (years of customer Fixes summarized for stylists); Expedia Group (1.26 quadrillion combinations across 3M properties + 500 airlines) |
| **Knowledge dissemination** | AI delivers personalized, inclusive knowledge access | Slack (native daily channel recaps; >700M messages/day); cloud services provider (TikTok-style micro-adaptive learning during COVID pivot) |

**The flywheel** ([[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron-Schrage]]):

1. **Verification** — *Does this output meet the standard?* Binary check against existing criteria. Unverified AI output is "noise with a confident tone." Verification used alone catches errors without generating learning.
2. **Evaluation** — *What does this output reveal?* May generate standards that did not exist before. Requires domain expertise. The expert as evaluator is *discovering what quality means in this new context*.
3. **Learning capture** — *How do we ensure this insight persists?* Version control for organizational judgment. Without it, evaluation is a one-time event; with it, every subsequent interaction starts smarter.

**The trap** (load-bearing claim): most organizations practice **verification masquerading as evaluation** — treating AI outputs as verdicts to confirm rather than starting points to interrogate. *Consumption dressed up as adoption.* The remedy: **deploy AI first in domains where your people already have deep expertise**, because evaluation requires someone capable of recognizing what "not perfect" actually means.

**Five concrete moves** (Kiron-Schrage):

1. **Preserve evaluation expertise** — domain expertise repositioned, the expert as *evaluator* rather than the expert as *producer*.
2. **Build verification mechanisms** — minimally viable verification (multijudge systems, consistency checks across formulations); start the cycle even when full verification is expensive.
3. **Institute evaluation practices** — after every significant AI interaction, ask: What worked? What failed? **What was *interestingly* wrong?** (The third question is where hidden value lives.)
4. **Create capture systems** — both inferential (patterns in accumulated traces) and explicit (decision journals, prompt repositories, evaluation logs). Discipline, not cost or creativity, is the true constraint.
5. **Measure the cycle, not just the output** — count verifications, evaluations, learning captures, and how quickly captured learning changes subsequent practice. Tools-adopted / hours-saved / tasks-completed are *consumption metrics*.

**Convergence with prior wiki claims**:

- The Augmented Learner traits map onto [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR Stage 3 attributes]] (test-and-learn, architected for reuse, human-feedback-loop AI).
- The verification → evaluation → learning capture cycle is the operational answer to [[micro-productivity-trap|the micro-productivity trap]] — Bain/OpenAI's "process lock-in" failure mode is what happens when verification masquerades as evaluation.
- "Return on iteration" (Kiron-Schrage's coining) is a candidate replacement metric for "ROI" in AI deployments, distinct from but adjacent to the **6-capability "Adoption and scaling" capability** in [[2026-05-03-rewired-second-edition-sample|Rewired 2nd ed]].

### The deployment-surface migration: coding moved to API ([[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves|Anthropic Economic Index, 5th report]])

A finding worth flagging because it changes how enterprise AI deployment shape should be read: between Aug 2025 and Feb 2026, the **share of coding work on Claude.ai dropped sharply** while the **share on the 1P API rose from 36% → 47%**. The mechanism, per AEI 5: as **agentic coding harnesses** ([[Claude Code]], Cursor, etc.) matured, coding work migrated *off* the conversational consumer surface and *onto* the API where many short directive task-labelled calls happen per actual task. This has two consequences for adoption measurement:

1. **Single-surface adoption metrics undercount the shift.** A survey that asks "do you use ChatGPT/Claude.ai" misses the place where enterprise coding adoption is now happening.
2. **Where automation is rising is surface-specific.** AEI 5's "automation rising on API" finding (sales, trading, coding harnesses) is consistent with the Claude.ai split staying flat (53/45 augmentation/automation). The aggregate "AI is automating" / "AI is augmenting" framing dissolves once you separate the consumer chat surface from the agent-mediated API surface.

Reinforces the [[micro-productivity-trap]] reading: the firms capturing real value from coding-AI today are the ones operating it through agentic harnesses on the API, not through individual ChatGPT/Claude.ai seats. The deployment surface itself is part of the maturity gradient.

## Debates / contradictions

- **High adoption vs. low maturity.** 78% adoption + 1% mature (per AI Index) and 28%+34% in Stages 1–2 + only 7% Stage 4 (per MIT CISR) describe an organization-wide scramble in early innings. Sources interpreting 78% as "AI is mainstream" are technically correct but misleading about depth. See [[ai-maturity-measurement-comparison]].
- **Methodology divergence between sources.** The AI Index uses McKinsey's binary "use in ≥1 function" instrument; MIT CISR uses a triangulated AI-effectiveness score across operations, CX, and ecosystem support, banded into 4 stages. Different definitions of "mature" — 1% (AI Index, GenAI specifically, C-suite self-report) vs. 7% (MIT CISR, Stage 4, score-based). [[ai-maturity-measurement-comparison]] tracks the cross-walk.
- **Replacement vs. augmentation.** [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] notes the workforce-reduction expectation is *declining*, hinting that early evidence supports augmentation (Jevons-paradox style demand expansion) over replacement. Open question: does that hold beyond 2024?
- **Equalizing effect persistence.** Robust in early studies. Open question: as AI tools mature, do high-skill workers eventually catch up by leveraging more sophisticated workflows? Or does the effect deepen as agents handle more of what high-skill humans currently do?
- **Methodology drift.** The AI Index 78% number comes from McKinsey's instrument; whether year-over-year comparisons are apples-to-apples depends on McKinsey holding the survey design steady. The MIT CISR Stage distribution comes from the **2022** Future Ready Survey, predating the GenAI explosion — so the 28/34/31/7 numbers should be read as *baseline*, not current.
- **Where the financial inflection is.** [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR]] locates it specifically at **Stage 2 → Stage 3** (pilots → scaled ways of working). [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]]'s function-level financial-impact data shows modest gains across all functions but doesn't directly speak to *between-stage* gradients. The MIT CISR claim is a sharper, more actionable framing.
