# Vibe Coding

The **intuitive, exploratory mode of writing code with an AI agent** — coined by [[Andrej Karpathy]] in 2024 and widely adopted as practitioner vocabulary through 2025–26. Karpathy's working framing in the [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Sequoia AI Ascent interview]] (29 April 2026):

> *"Vibe coding is about raising the floor for everyone in terms of what they can do in software. The floor rises, everyone can vibe code anything, and that's amazing — incredible."*

Vibe coding is the **democratisation half of [[software-3.0]]**: it makes software-creation accessible to people who don't have classical software-engineering backgrounds. Its complement — [[agentic-engineering]] — is the *professionals' half*, where the same substrate is wielded with quality discipline. The wiki holds both as **two complementary modes of the same Software 3.0 substrate**, not opposites.

## Working definition

A **vibe-coding session** is one in which the human:

- Has a goal in mind (build a thing, try an idea, scratch an itch).
- Describes the goal to an agent in natural language, often without rigorous specification.
- Iterates by *feel* — looks at the output, asks for changes, accepts what works.
- Does *not* take responsibility for production-grade properties (security, scalability, maintainability, code aesthetics).

The *vibe* in vibe coding refers to the **mood/feel-driven iteration loop**, in contrast to the *spec-and-test-driven* iteration loop of traditional software engineering.

## Key claims

### The "December 2025 phase change" — vibe coding tipped from useful to trustworthy

[[Andrej Karpathy]]'s [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|first-person account]] of the moment vibe coding stabilised:

> *"I've been using agentic tools like [Claude] code and adjacent things for a while, maybe over the last year as it came out, and it was very good at chunks of code and sometimes it would mess up and you have to edit them. December was this clear point where for me — I was on a break, so I had a bit more time, I think many other people were similar — and I just started to notice that with the latest models the chunks just came out fine. And then I kept asking for more and it just came out fine. And then I can't remember the last time I corrected it. And I just trusted the system more and more. And then I was vibe coding."*

The structural claim: a single-month phase change in late 2025 when **the correction overhead dropped to ~zero** for a sufficiently broad class of tasks. This is not just "models got better" — it's the threshold at which the *iteration loop* changes shape (from generate → review → edit → retry to generate → accept).

Two consequences Karpathy notes:

1. **"My side projects folder is extremely full"** — when the friction drops to zero, the volume of personal experimentation explodes.
2. The shift was **not visible at the typical user's distance** — most people experienced AI in 2024 as "ChatGPT-adjacent thing." Karpathy stresses on Twitter/X that you have to *look again* in late 2025 because the agentic-coherent-workflow has changed fundamentally.

### Vibe coding raises the floor

The democratisation claim is the load-bearing operational outcome:

- People who could not previously write code can now build working software.
- Engineers who were intimidated by an unfamiliar stack (frontend if they're backend; mobile if they're web; etc.) can now ship across stacks.
- Side-project velocity for individual operators goes up multiple orders of magnitude.

The wiki's [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] page tracks the *organisational* analogue of this; vibe coding is the *individual* analogue.

### What vibe coding is *not*

Karpathy is explicit that vibe coding is **not the same as professional software engineering at agent speed**:

> *"Agentic engineering is about preserving the quality bar of what existed before in professional software. You're not allowed to introduce vulnerabilities due to vibe coding. You're still responsible for your software just as before."*

The danger in conflating them: vibe-coded artifacts shipped to production *as if* they were agentic-engineered carry risks (security, correctness, maintainability) that the vibe-coding loop didn't validate. The wiki tracks this as an open hazard — see [[agentic-engineering]] for the quality-discipline complement.

## When vibe coding is the right tool

- **Side projects.** Personal experiments, weekend builds, hobbyist apps. The Karpathy [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Menu Gen]] story is a vibe-coded artifact; he then *reasoned about* it through an [[agentic-engineering]] lens (and concluded most of it was spurious).
- **Throwaway scripts.** Glue code, one-off data transformations, ad-hoc analysis.
- **Proof-of-concept demos.** Where the goal is to learn *whether* something is possible, not yet to ship it reliably.
- **Education and exploration.** Learning a new framework or library by having an agent walk you through a working example.
- **Stakeholder-influence prototypes for non-engineers.** Per [[2025-12-01-marily-nika-pms-who-use-ai-will-replace-those-who-dont|Nika 2025]], the canonical PM use of v0 / Lovable / Google AI Studio is to turn a PRD into a clickable prototype *before* asking for engineering allocation, then take the prototype into a product review where stakeholders can touch / feel / move-around the vision. The prototype is **a communication and influence-engineering tool**, not a design artifact. This is vibe coding's *first-class non-engineer professional use* — the floor-raising claim made operational for the PM audience specifically.

## When vibe coding is the wrong tool

- **Production systems handling third-party data, money, or identity.** Karpathy's email-matching-Stripe-and-Google-accounts bug is a vibe-coding-shipped-to-production failure mode.
- **Code that other engineers will maintain.** Vibe-coded code is often *bloaty, copy-paste-heavy, awkward in its abstractions, brittle* (Karpathy's own description) — fine for a one-off, expensive to inherit.
- **Anything that requires correctness verification.** Vibe coding's iteration loop trusts the model's output; for verifiable domains, the more rigorous [[agentic-engineering]] loop (with formal contracts and adversarial testing) is the right pattern.
- **Anything safety-critical.** Same reason as above — the vibe loop doesn't validate against an explicit quality bar.

## Convergence with other wiki claims

|---|---|
| [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering\|Karpathy 2026]] | Original coinage + December 2025 phase change + the floor-vs-ceiling contrast with [[agentic-engineering]] |
| [[2026-04-28-dellacqua-jagged-technological-frontier\|Dell'Acqua et al. 2026]] | The empirical underbelly: vibe-coded output *inside* the [[jagged-frontier]] is genuinely good; *outside* it can degrade performance even relative to the un-AI-assisted baseline |
| [[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves\|AEI 5]] | Capacity-ceiling caveat: vibe coding works at single-task scale; once tasks compose (multi-step, long-horizon) the ceiling becomes load-bearing, and you need [[agentic-engineering]] |
| [[2025-12-01-marily-nika-pms-who-use-ai-will-replace-those-who-dont\|Nika 2025 (How I AI)]] | The **PM-side worked example** + the **earliest contemporary primary source** for the December 2025 phase change. A Google AI Product Lead, on camera in late November / early December 2025, doing the workflow live (Perplexity → custom GPT → v0 → Veo/Sora → NotebookLM) and treating the tool stack as already-trustworthy. Substantiates *floor-raising* with a non-engineer professional (PM) audience: vibe coding's clickable-prototype pattern as **stakeholder influence engineering**, not just hobbyist iteration. *"PMs that use AI are the ones that are going to take over the role of people that don't use AI."* |
| [[2026-05-06-bockeler-engineering-of-ai-agents-context-harnessing-autonomy\|Böckeler 2026 (Thoughtworks at QCon London)]] | **Conference-circuit timeline anchor**. Böckeler's year-on-year QCon retrospective dates *"the term vibe coding was about 2 months old"* at QCon London 2025, anchoring the term's coinage to early 2025 from an independent observer (consultancy practitioner). Frames vibe coding as one end of an autonomy spectrum the broader [[agent-harness]] discipline now attempts to widen *safely* — directly compatible with Karpathy's floor-vs-ceiling split |
| [[2026-04-14-thompson-the-daily-workers-letting-ai-do-their-jobs\|Thompson 2026 (NYT / The Daily)]] | **75-developer field-report anchor**. The wiki's first cross-industry survey of working software developers — Thompson reports *"a majority outsourcing day-to-day programming to AI"*, with **small startups at ~100% AI-written code** (full-day features now ~30 min, ~20x faster) and **Google at ~40-50%** AI-written code with ~10% overall speedup. Dates the developer-side phase change to *"last 6 months, accelerating in the last 3"* — i.e. November 2025 → February 2026, ~4 months behind Nika's PM-side December-2025 phase change. Vibe coding observed in production at the small-startup floor; the consultant-observer + journalist-observer + vendor-engineer + practitioner vantages now all align on the same transition |
| [[2025-05-06-jassy-amazon-agility-ai-strategy-changing-role-of-managers\|Jassy 2025 (Amazon CEO on HBR IdeaCast)]] | **Pre-coinage CEO anchor for the floor-raising thesis** — the wiki's earliest vendor-CEO statement of the natural-language-coding democratisation prediction. Jassy in May 2025: *"the number of people who are going to be able to be software developers is going to go up exponentially. Because you're going to have these coding apps that allow you to use natural language to describe what you want to go build. And it's going to be very empowering."* Predates [[Andrej Karpathy]]'s vibe-coding coinage by ~12 months and Nika's December-2025 PM-side worked example by ~7 months. The qualifying *"but"* clause (US-education-quality concern: *"30 out of 35 developed countries in efficacy of education"*) anticipates the wiki's [[ai-deskilling]] / [[durable-skills]] concern that floor-raising democratisation depends on a baseline of human capability that may itself be eroding |
| [[2026-04-24-hu-yc-how-to-build-a-company-with-ai-from-the-ground-up\|Hu 2026 (YC Partner / Startup School)]] | **Company-scale extension of the floor-raising thesis**. Hu: *"Everyone comes to meetings with working prototypes not pitch decks. Everyone builds and ops support sales."* Vibe-coding as an *organisational norm* rather than just an individual skill — extends Nika's PM-side worked example into a cross-function expectation. The startup-edge claim — *"design your systems, workflows and culture around AI from the start and operate thousand times faster than the incumbents"* — applies the floor-raising thesis at the firm-formation level. Adds the **YC-partner observer vantage** to the wiki's growing cluster on the prediction-and-its-materialisation arc (Jassy May 2025 prediction / Nika December 2025 worked-example / Karpathy April 2026 coinage / Thompson April 2026 75-developer survey / Hu April 2026 company-scale prescription) |
| [[2026-04-25-masad-replit-ceo-only-two-jobs-left\|Masad 2026 (Replit CEO / YC Founder Firesides)]] | **Vendor-CEO platform-launch anchor + audience refinement**. Masad: *"September 2024, Replit became the first like what's called vibe-coding product where we abstracted away code entirely."* Replit's commercial vibe-coding launch **predates Karpathy's December-2025 phase-change framing by ~3 months on the platform side** — the floor-raising transition required infrastructure to materialise, and Replit shipped that infrastructure before the broader phase change. Two further refinements: (a) **Traditional developers don't get the most value** — *"developers like the pain... It's sort of like a craftsperson liking to build their own tools. People that are getting the most value tend to be the more tech-adjacent ones — PMs, designers, entrepreneurs"*; the audience-pipeline framing now generalises beyond Nika's PM-side anchor to *all tech-adjacent non-developers* + domain experts (physical therapists, pool-business operators, sports-club ops, parents tracking rare conditions). (b) **Post-prompting product direction** — *"I actually think we're headed to a post-prompting world... at some point Agent 5 or maybe sooner, you should be able to tell Replit, 'every day build me a SaaS company and try to market it and see what works.'"* Marks the wiki's first identification of a *post-prompting* trajectory inside vibe-coding-as-platform. Also names the **vibe-coding-resident team** — a generalist team with deliberately vague mission *"go around the company and make it better"* deputising agents — as an organisational pattern materialised inside Replit itself. Pair with Hu's *"everyone builds and ops support sales"* (the day before): same idea, founder-CEO worked example |
| [[2026-04-23-tan-yc-how-to-make-claude-code-your-ai-engineering-team-gstack\|Tan 2026 (YC President / GStack)]] | **Live demo of vibe-coding-with-discipline at YC-president scale**. Tan walks through *idea → adversarial review → design mockups → code → QA* in a single Claude Code session — the entire ~10-min demo *is* a worked example of the floor-raising thesis materialised. Closing peroration: *"the barrier to building just collapsed. The only question left is what are you going to build? It's time to let it rip. Go make something people want."* GStack as the **packaged toolkit that turns the floor-raising-into-a-discipline transition** into a one-CLI-install workflow. With Hu the day before, the **YC-batch-context anchor pair** (Tan 23 April + Hu 24 April) frames vibe-coding-as-organisational-baseline from the platform that funds the floor-raised cohort |
| [[2026-05-13-jha-emergent-democratizing-app-building-with-claude\|Jha 2026 (Emergent CEO / Anthropic Applied AI interview)]] | **Strongest 2026 named-company anchor on the floor-raising thesis materialised at scale**. **7M users in 190 countries; 70–80% have never written a line of code; $100M ARR in 8 months.** The audience refinement Masad named at Replit (*tech-adjacent non-developers + domain experts*) is operationalised here as *small businesses and domain experts as the primary user class* — the wiki's clearest 2026 vignette is **Christy, a clinical psychologist and equestrian coach in Alaska**, who had paid $50K to a Nova Scotia dev shop for an app that didn't work, switched to Emergent and shipped *"Equ"* on the App Store with hundreds of users. Jha's framing of *zero marginal cost serving million niches of SMB / domain-expert needs* (*"70% of employment, 50% of GDP"*) is the wiki's compactest statement of vibe-coding-as-economic-democratisation. With [[2026-04-25-masad-replit-ceo-only-two-jobs-left\|Masad / Replit]], the wiki now holds **two named-CEO 2026 anchors** for the natural-language-to-production-app platform category — distinct technical architectures (Replit on own Agent N stack; Emergent on Claude + own multi-agent harness on Kubernetes), shared user-class thesis |
| [[2026-02-06-figma-make-prompts-to-prototypes-with-claude\|Figma Make customer story 2026]] | **Incumbent-design-tool-vendor expression** of the floor-raising thesis. *"I don't code. One of the best innovations of the past couple of years is that I really don't have to in order to create the things I want to do."* Same first-person *"I don't have to code"* claim as Karpathy / Nika / Replit-users but from inside a design-tool incumbent, with the discriminator *"every single person who has taste can just enact it all that easier"* — taste as the load-bearing human contribution, Claude as the *enactment* layer. Adds the **design-tool-vendor vantage** to the wiki's vibe-coding anchors alongside Replit / Emergent (general-purpose vibe-coding platforms) and the YC-batch context (Tan / Hu) |
| [[2025-12-22-randell-gousset-microsoft-agentic-devops-in-real-life\|Randell & Gousset / Microsoft Dec 2025]] | **The "can you vibe debug it?" security caveat, with a worked failure**. Randell: *"you can vibe code, but can you vibe debug it?"* — then narrates vibe-coding a Chrome bookmark-manager extension with [[Anthropic\|Claude]], having [[OpenAI\|Codex]] review Claude's code (*"looked good"*), pushing to [[GitHub]] — and [[GitHub]] Advanced Security still catching a **URL-injection vulnerability multiple times**. *"Two smart AI agents still screwed up and GitHub had my back."* The wiki's cleanest vendor-keynote articulation of the *vibe-coding-needs-a-safety-net* corollary: floor-raising is real, but shipping vibe-coded output to production without scanning/review is the failure mode — directly compatible with the floor-vs-[[agentic-engineering\|ceiling]] split and the [[responsible-ai]] human-in-the-loop default |
| [[2026-06-11-kilpatrick-sequoia-model-eats-the-harness\|Kilpatrick 2026 (Sequoia / Google DeepMind)]] | **Platform-scale floor-raising datum + the personal-software thesis**. AI Studio saw **350,000 Android apps built in one week** — *"apps that probably no one was going to build before,"* many personal/single-user. Kilpatrick: *"building software to solve your personal problem is very real right now."* Most-built AI Studio categories: ~20% finance/crypto, games (was ~20%), personal productivity, gen media. Extends the Emergent/Replit *domain-expert audience* claim onto the **Android-app-on-AI-Studio surface**, with Android framed as *"the platform for builders."* The same interview's *model-eats-the-harness* thesis also reinforces the [[agent-harness]] note below: vibe coding runs on a thin/absent harness because the model absorbs the scaffolding |
| [[2026-04-21-forsgren-macvean-build-core-skills-thrive-ai-era-developer\|Forsgren & Macvean / Google I/O 2026]] | **The corporate-research ceiling-side negative claim**. *"Our top engineers are **not** vibe coding. They are not prompting for code. What they're doing is designing environments, setting the guardrails, creating the systems so that agents and humans can work together toward a goal and a broader purpose."* The cleanest Google-Research articulation of the floor-vs-ceiling split — vibe coding raises the floor (acknowledged elsewhere in the talk via the Search-org PM story); but at the ceiling, top engineers explicitly do *not* vibe code, they practise [[agentic-engineering]]. With DORA's amplifier-and-mirror framing: *"if you lack deep engineering understanding... AI can run the risk of generating technical and cognitive debt at an incredibly fast rate"* — the published-by-Google operationalisation of the *"why vibe-coding-shipped-to-production is the wrong tool"* claim |

## Debates and supersession

- **Is "vibe coding" a derogatory term or a legitimate mode?** When the term first spread on Twitter/X in 2024–25, some practitioners used it dismissively (*"that's just vibe coding, not real engineering"*). Karpathy's [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Sequoia framing]] resolves this: vibe coding is a *legitimate mode* (floor-raising democratisation) — the dismissive framing is misplaced because it conflates vibe coding with agentic engineering. The wiki adopts Karpathy's resolution.
- **Does the December 2025 phase change generalise beyond Karpathy's experience?** ~~No second source has yet ingested a parallel first-person account.~~ *Partially answered* by [[2025-12-01-marily-nika-pms-who-use-ai-will-replace-those-who-dont|Nika 2025]] — a Google AI Product Lead doing the workflow live on camera in late November / December 2025, contemporary with Karpathy's named pivot. This isn't a survey or controlled study, but it is a second independent practitioner whose tool-stack is already trustworthy by the date Karpathy retroactively names. The remaining open question is whether a *population-level* signal (survey / empirical study) confirms it across professional audiences; the wiki now holds *two* practitioner anchors at the engineer (Karpathy) and PM (Nika) ends.
- **Will vibe coding always need an [[agentic-engineering]] complement, or will model improvements close the gap?** Karpathy's view: *"I'm hoping that improves… there's nothing fundamental preventing it. It's just the labs haven't done it yet."* If labs add aesthetics-as-RL-reward and agent code stops being *bloaty / awkward / brittle*, the gap between vibe coding and agentic engineering narrows substantially. Open question.

## Related concepts

- [[software-3.0]] — the substrate; vibe coding is the floor-raising mode of Software 3.0.
- [[agentic-engineering]] — the discipline complement; same substrate, professional quality bar.
- [[ai-agents]] — the *intern entities* you vibe-code with.
- [[agent-harness]] — vibe coding can happen with a thin or absent harness; [[agentic-engineering]] requires a substantial one.
- [[jagged-frontier]] — vibe coding inside the frontier is genuinely good; outside it, the iteration loop trusts model output that may be wrong.

## Open questions

- **Empirical measurement of the December 2025 phase change.** Karpathy's account is first-person; a population-level signal would lift this concept's confidence.
- **The vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering boundary in practice.** When does a vibe-coded side project earn promotion to agentic engineering? Karpathy's Menu Gen example was vibe-coded then *replaced entirely* by a Software 3.0 prompt — a rarer pattern than gradual hardening. Worth tracking which trajectory dominates.
- **Will vibe coding remain the *individual* mode or become the *team* mode too?** Currently it's framed for solo operators. If teams adopt vibe-coding loops collectively (with each member trusting the agent's output without review), the safety implications change substantially. Open.
- **Tooling specialisation.** Will vibe-coding-specific IDEs/tools emerge that are explicitly *not* agentic-engineering-grade (lower friction, weaker guardrails)? The pet-vibe-coding tools that exist today (Replit's Agent, Cursor's vibe modes) hint at this; second sources documenting the trajectory would be useful.
