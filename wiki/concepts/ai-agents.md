# AI Agents

Software systems that **pursue complex goals autonomously**, with independent decision-making, planning, and adaptable execution in dynamic environments — typically built on top of [[foundation-models]] with tool-use, memory, and orchestration scaffolding. Agents are distinct from chatbots (which simulate conversation) and from multi-agent systems (which coordinate multiple agents).

As of 2024–2025, agents have moved from research-grade demos to **early enterprise deployment**, with growing convergence on a 3-stage progression and on the kinds of tasks where agents are economically viable today. By April–May 2026 the wiki's sources also converge on a **runtime-engineering** vantage: the [[agent-harness]] (the wrapper around the model) drives more performance variation than the model itself — see [[2026-05-04-rethinking-agents-harness-is-all-you-need|the empirical anchor]] showing same-model 6× variance and harness optimisations transferring across model families. [[Andrej Karpathy]]'s practitioner framing in the [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Sequoia AI Ascent interview]] (29 April 2026) names the discipline that wields all this — [[agentic-engineering]] — and frames agents themselves as **intern entities**: *"remarkable, but you basically still have to be in charge of the aesthetics, the judgment, the taste, and a little bit of oversight."* The intern-entities framing is now the wiki's working idiom for *what kind of workforce* agents constitute.

## Working definition

The cleanest definition in this wiki comes from [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]'s 3-stage progression:

| Stage | What it is | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **AI chatbot** | Simulates and processes human conversation, written or spoken | Customer support FAQ bots; ChatGPT in default mode |
| **AI agent** | Pursues complex goals autonomously, with independent decision-making, planning, and adaptable execution in dynamic environments | Salesforce Agentforce (business operations); Italgas DANA (network control); coding agents |
| **Multi-agent system** | Multiple AI agents collaborate to pursue complex goals autonomously in dynamic environments | (Emerging — fewer production examples as of 2025) |

A useful complementary lens is the [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]] 2×2: agents thrive in the **"no regrets zone"** (low cost of errors + explicit data) where AI does the work without humans in the loop — addressing bulk customer inquiries, summarizing documents, screening résumés. As error costs rise, agents become assistants rather than autonomous executors.

## Key claims

### The 2024–25 inflection

- **Salesforce launched Agentforce** in September 2024 — a suite of autonomous AI agents for business operations across the Salesforce platform. Source: [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §4.1 timeline.
- **>80% of organizations plan to integrate AI agents within 1–3 years** ([[Capgemini]] research via [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]).
- **AI agents could double the capacity** of knowledge professionals and field-support roles ([[PwC]] prediction via MITTRI/Cisco).
- [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR]]'s Four Stages framework places "exploring autonomous agents" as a **Stage 3** (Develop AI ways of working) attribute, and "combining traditional + generative + agentic + robotic AI" as a **Stage 4** (Become AI future-ready) attribute. Stage 4 covers only **7%** of firms (2022 baseline) — agents at scale remain rare.

### Capability evidence (RE-Bench, 2024)

[[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] §2 discusses **RE-Bench** — a 2024 benchmark for evaluating complex tasks for AI agents under time budgets:
- In **2-hour budgets**: top AI systems score **4× human experts**.
- At **32-hour budgets**: humans win **2:1** over AI.
- AI agents already match human expertise on select tasks (e.g., writing Triton kernels) — at lower cost and higher speed.

The time-budget pattern is a sharp framing: **agents win at short horizons, humans still win at long horizons.** Most enterprise tasks have short horizons, which is why agent deployment is accelerating despite long-horizon weakness.

### Where agents are deployed in 2024–25

- **Salesforce Agentforce** (cross-functional enterprise agents)
- **GitHub Copilot** family (coding assistance evolving toward agents) — see [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]]
- **Harvey** (legal contract drafting) — Anand-Wu cite it for the "quality control zone"
- **Italgas DANA** — generative-AI-based network control system for natural gas distribution. Source: [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT Sloan]].
- **Cisco's customer-support agents** — Cisco internal deployment per [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]].
- **Claude Code** ([[Anthropic]]) — agentic coding harness now leaving a *measurable* signature in usage data: per the [[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves|fifth Anthropic Economic Index report]] (Feb 2026), the 1P API task-share for "Computer & Mathematical" jumped from 36% (Aug 2025) to 47% (Feb 2026), driven in large part by coding agents that decompose work into many shorter task-labelled API calls. Where Claude.ai shows a single user-Claude conversation per task, an agentic harness shows up as N labelled calls per task — agents are visible in the data, not just in product launches.

### The application-layer counterpart: the agent harness

Throughout April–May 2026 a body of practitioner writing converged on **[[agent-harness|agent harness]]** as the dominant frame for production-grade agent engineering at the application layer — *complementary* to Anthropic's brain/hands/session at the platform layer. Two new wiki sources name the construct directly:

- [[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]] — provocation-style argument that "agent harness" is mostly **systems design we've always done** with a 10% genuinely novel kernel (non-determinism at the execution layer + context as a degrading resource). 4-layer stack: Your App / Harness Frameworks (LangChain, Microsoft Agent Framework, Google ADK, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Haystack, DSPy) / Agent Harness Runtime / swappable Model Layer.
- [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]] — taxonomical 4-layer anatomy: **Context** (system prompt as a document, KV-cached stable parts + dynamic parts) / **Constraints** (pre/post-tool middleware: destructive-verb detection, workspace isolation, loop detection, output scoring) / **Contracts** (formal evaluable specifications of "successful output" calibrated to inputs) / **Compounding** (telemetry as training data for the harness itself, with human-reviewed workspace overrides).

The full treatment of the harness construct lives in the dedicated [[agent-harness]] concept page; this section flags the connection from the [[ai-agents|ai-agents]] page.

**Worked failure mode worth flagging here**: Chatterjee's *Friday-in-March* story — a user said "clean things up before the board review"; the agent — *competent, helpful, working exactly as designed* — interpreted this as archive stale documents + prune duplicates + remove stale sources, soft-deleting two weeks of research history 40 minutes before a board meeting. **The model was not the problem.** The problem was the absence of an intent-validation layer in the harness. The lesson generalizes: **most agent failures in production are harness failures, not model failures.**

**Practitioner consensus on the implication**: build constraints before you build cleverness; the model is rented and replaceable; the harness is owned and compounds.

### Engineering pattern: brain / hands / session decoupling

The [[2026-05-07-anthropic-managed-agents-decoupling-brain-hands|Anthropic Managed Agents]] engineering post (8 April 2026) names the architecture beneath production-grade agents — the layer the working-definition table abstracts over. Three concerns are deliberately split into independently-scaled tiers:

| Tier | What it is | Why decoupled |
|---|---|---|
| **Brain** | The model + tool-use/reasoning loop | LLM inference is bursty and stateless; scale on its own clock |
| **Hands** | Tool execution surface (code interpreter, browser, MCP servers, file system) | Each tool has its own latency, blast-radius, and security profile; isolation per-tool is mandatory |
| **Session** | Long-running orchestration state — memory, conversation history, intermediate artefacts that outlive any one model call | A *session* is **not** the same as the model's context window: sessions can run for hours and span context resets |

Two consequences worth marking:

- **Security as structural unreachability, not as policy.** The hands tier runs in a sandbox the brain cannot directly drive — the model emits tool-call requests, and a separate executor decides whether and how to run them. This is the engineering version of the [[responsible-ai|"agent risk"]] story: rather than relying on the model to *refuse* dangerous actions, the architecture makes most dangerous actions structurally unreachable.
- **"Context anxiety" is model-specific.** The post observes that [[Claude Sonnet 4.5]] sometimes wraps up tasks prematurely when its context window fills — a failure mode not present on **Claude Opus 4.5** under the same harness. This is the first empirical evidence in this wiki that long-horizon agent reliability varies by model within a family, not just across families. It also reframes the RE-Bench 32-hour finding: long-horizon weakness is partly an **architectural** problem (context window saturation) and partly a **model-quality** problem (how the model responds when saturation looms).

### Capgemini's expected agent benefits (n unknown, sponsor-cited)

| Expectation | % agreeing |
|---|---|
| AI agents will help drive higher levels of automation in workflows | 71% |
| AI agents will significantly improve customer service, leading to improved satisfaction | 64% |
| AI agents would help me focus on more value-added activities | 64% |
| The potential of AI agents to improve productivity outweighs the risks | 57% |

Source: [[Capgemini]] 2025 via [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]. **Caveat:** the 57% on "outweighs the risks" is the lowest-scoring item — material minority concern.

### The CX angle

Customer experience (CX) is the most-cited near-term agent application. Per [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]:
- Customers are **3.8× more likely to purchase again** following a successful service experience.
- "It's not about replacing roles. It's about where we can give agency, with some human oversight and governance, to improve tasks within a workflow." — [[Liz Centoni]], EVP & Chief CX Officer, [[Cisco]].

## Debates / contradictions

- **Where in the org does an agent sit?** The 4 sources frame agents differently:
  - [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR]]: agents as a **Stage 3+ attribute** — only mature orgs are exploring them.
  - [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]]: agents as a **task-quadrant attribute** — they thrive in the no-regrets zone today, regardless of org maturity stage.
  - [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]: agents as the **near-term productivity story for everyone** (>80% planning integration in 1–3 years).
  Reconciling: agents are *deployable today* in low-cost-of-error / explicit-data domains, *strategic* at higher maturity, and *projected* by most orgs. All three views can be true.
- **Agentic vs. agent.** "Agentic" is sometimes used to describe behavior (autonomous, goal-pursuing) while "agent" is the system. The wiki uses both interchangeably for now; future ingests may force more precision.
- **Hype vs. capability gap.** RE-Bench shows agents losing to humans at 32-hour budgets. Many enterprise workflows have multi-day horizons. The [[2026-05-07-anthropic-managed-agents-decoupling-brain-hands|Managed Agents post]] partially reframes the gap as **architectural** (context-window saturation, brain/hands coupling) rather than purely capability-based — the brain/hands/session split is precisely the bet that long-horizon weakness is fixable with scaffolding. Open question: how much of the 32-hour gap closes with better orchestration vs. requires better models?
- **Multi-agent systems are mostly aspirational.** MITTRI/Cisco frames the 3-stage progression as if multi-agent is on a near-term horizon, but production multi-agent systems remain rare. Discount accordingly.
