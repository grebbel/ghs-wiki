# AI Deskilling

A specific mechanism by which AI changes work: **the task composition of a job shifts toward lower-education-content tasks because higher-education-content tasks are AI-handled**. The job persists; its content changes.

This is distinct from **displacement** (the job goes away) and from **wage compression** (pay narrows). Deskilling can occur even when employment and wages are stable.

## Working definition

Deskilling, in the [[Anthropic Economic Index]] sense ([[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|fourth report]]):

- For each occupation, predict the education content of every constituent task.
- Identify which tasks are already covered by AI (using Claude.ai as a proxy).
- Compute what the *remaining* task mix looks like if AI-covered tasks are removed.
- If the average education content of remaining tasks is *lower* than the original average, the job is deskilled on this measure.

## Key claims

### First-order deskilling, on average ([[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|Anthropic Economic Index, 4th report]])

- Tasks covered by Claude average **14.4 years** of predicted education (≈ U.S. associate's degree).
- All tasks economy-wide (employment-weighted) average **13.2 years**.
- Removing the AI-covered portion of jobs would, as a first-order effect, lower the education content of what remains — hence "deskilling."

### Most-affected occupations (per the report's worked examples)

- Technical writers
- Travel agents
- Teachers

### Counter-examples

- **Real estate managers** — move the *opposite* direction (AI covers their lower-education tasks; remaining tasks skew higher).

### Author caveat

> "We're not necessarily predicting that this deskilling will occur: it's possible that even if AI fully automated the tasks it currently supports, the labor market would dynamically adjust in ways that this analysis doesn't account for."

The report frames the analysis as a *useful first-order signal*, not a labor-market forecast.

## First-person developer worked example: Pia Torian ([[2026-04-14-thompson-the-daily-workers-letting-ai-do-their-jobs|Thompson 2026 (NYT The Daily)]])

The wiki's first **first-person developer self-report** of measurable deskilling, surfaced in [[2026-04-14-thompson-the-daily-workers-letting-ai-do-their-jobs|Thompson 2026]]'s 75-developer survey:

- **Pia Torian** — *"reasonably newer developer"*; early-job employers required heavy [[Microsoft]] Copilot use; *"hundreds of prompts a day for months"*. Her self-report: *"this is actually degrading my own knowledge of code. I feel like I'm losing my ability to code."*

The senior-developer vantage Thompson surfaces is the **inter-generational worry**:

> *"They would tell me that it's great for us to have the AI agents because if they produce something wrong or flabby, we have the experience to look at that and go, 'That's not good. Do it again.' And they would all say, 'Well, what about the next generation? Are we going to discover 5 or 10 years from now that the next generation of software developers, you know, just simply don't have that deep code sense that lets them be really, really good engineers?'"*

The structural concern: code-review-of-AI-output competence depends on having previously developed *code sense* by writing code by hand. If new developers never go through that phase, the corrective-review skill never develops — leaving the team without anyone who can catch subtle bad-pattern AI output. This is **selection-instrument decay** at the human-capital layer: the senior developers who can spot bad AI work are also the developers who learned to code in the pre-AI era; their cohort is non-renewable.

Convergent with Sternfels' *"durable leadership skills"* framing (judgment, discontinuous-leap thinking) from a hiring vantage, and with [[2026-05-06-bockeler-engineering-of-ai-agents-context-harnessing-autonomy|Böckeler's]] *"you have to be this tall to ride the roller coaster"* — the skill required to *safely reduce supervision* is the skill agentic engineering is potentially eroding.

## The inverse frame: durable skills ([[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al. 2026]])

If deskilling tracks *which skills get hollowed out by AI*, [[durable-skills]] tracks *which skills resist substitution* — the same labor-economics question viewed from the other side. The two frames carve up the labor-skill space:

- **Codified-and-AI-substitutable** — what deskilling depletes (information retrieval, formulaic generation, well-defined procedural tasks).
- **Open-ended-and-AI-resistant** — what durable-skills measures (collaboration, creativity, critical thinking; skills requiring grounding in social/contextual reality).

[[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al. (Google Research 2026)]] provide the **first scalable operational measurement** for the durable-skills side via the Vantage / Executive LLM platform — large-N validation (188 participants, 373 conversations, Pearson 0.88 with human experts on creativity tasks). Without this measurement methodology, claims about which skills "should" be retained as AI handles more codified work were prescriptive without empirical anchoring. With it, the deskilling-vs-durable-skills carve becomes empirically tractable.

## Open questions

- Single-source coverage so far. A second source measuring task-composition shift via different methodology would strengthen the concept.
- How does deskilling interact with within-role equalizing effects observed in [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|customer-support productivity studies]]? Different units of analysis (across-task education content vs. within-occupation worker skill); a synthesis page may become warranted with a third source.
