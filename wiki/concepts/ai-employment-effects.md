# AI Employment Effects

The empirical record of how AI is affecting employment levels, hiring, wages, and occupational composition in real labor markets. As of late 2025, the wiki's evidence converges on a specific pattern: **early-career workers in highly AI-exposed occupations are seeing relative employment declines**, concentrated in automation rather than augmentation uses, with adjustments visible in headcount more than wages.

This page is distinct from [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] (which is about how organizations *use* AI) and from [[automation-vs-augmentation]] (which is about *how* AI is deployed task-by-task). The focus here is the *labor-market consequences*.

## Working definition

"AI employment effects" = the measurable changes in **employment levels, hiring rates, wages, and occupational composition** attributable (in whole or in part) to the deployment of generative AI and AI agents in workplaces. The literature distinguishes:

- **Direct displacement** — workers losing jobs because AI now does the task
- **Reduced hiring** — firms hiring fewer new workers because existing workers are more productive (or AI substitutes for them)
- **Compositional shift** — jobs not lost in aggregate, but the *mix* of work changes (tasks redistributed across roles)
- **Wage effects** — pay differentials between AI-exposed and non-exposed workers
- **Skill-biased effects** — differential outcomes by age, education, experience

## Key claims

### The 2024–25 inflection in entry-level employment ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]])

Using ADP payroll data (~25M U.S. workers, monthly Jan 2021–July 2025):

- **Early-career workers (ages 22–25) in the most AI-exposed occupations: ~13% relative decline** in employment since late 2022, after controlling for firm-level shocks.
- **Software developers ages 22–25**: employment declined nearly **20%** from peak in late 2022 to July 2025.
- **Updated job-postings signal** ([[2026-04-14-thompson-the-daily-workers-letting-ai-do-their-jobs|Thompson 2026 (NYT The Daily)]]): Thompson cites a *more recent* Brynjolfsson job-postings analysis showing **software-developer hires down 16%** *"in the last year or so"* — i.e. extending the 2022-onset effect into 2025-26 at the *hiring* (not just employment-stock) layer. Thompson's framing: *"if that's happening when the AI coding tools are really just going from a crawl to a walk to a run, what might happen when they're sprinting?"* — primary-source ingest of the underlying job-postings analysis is an open target.
- **22–25 year-olds in highest AI-exposure quintiles**: -6% absolute from late 2022 to July 2025.
- **35–49 year-olds in same occupations**: +6% to +9%.
- **22–25 year-olds in lower exposure quintiles**: +6% to +13% (no clear ordering by exposure).
- **Less-exposed occupations** (stock clerks, health aides): no age divergence pattern.

The pattern emerged *specifically around late 2022*, coincident with ChatGPT's release. Did not appear during the COVID-19 unemployment spike — so it's not a generic "young workers struggle in downturns" effect.

### Automation vs. augmentation matters more than exposure level ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]] Fact 3)

Using the [[Anthropic Economic Index]] classification of AI uses as automation vs. augmentation:

- Occupations with **highest automation share**: declining employment for youngest workers.
- Occupations with **highest augmentation share**: **NO** similar pattern — most-augmentative quintile shows fastest growth.

This is empirical evidence for a distinction that has been mostly conceptual in other sources ([[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]]'s 2×2 framework, [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]]'s "give agency with human oversight"). See [[automation-vs-augmentation]].

### Wage stickiness: employment moves before wages ([[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]] Fact 5)

- Annual salary trends show little difference by age or AI-exposure quintile.
- "AI may have larger effects on employment than on wages, at least initially."
- Implication: labor markets adjust through hiring/headcount before pay — consistent with a long literature on wage rigidity.

### The codified-vs-tacit knowledge mechanism

[[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]] propose a clean theoretical mechanism:

> AI replaces **codified knowledge** (the "book-learning" of formal education) more than **tacit knowledge** (the idiosyncratic tips and tricks accumulated with experience). Young workers supply relatively more codified than tacit knowledge, so they face greater task replacement.

This maps directly to [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu's]] "type of knowledge" axis (explicit data vs. tacit knowledge) — a strong cross-source convergence.

### Workforce expectations vs. realized outcomes

[[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR]] McKinsey survey:
- 31% of orgs expect little change in workforce size over 3 years.
- 43% expect decreases (8% by >20%, 14% by 11–20%, 21% by 3–10%).
- 23% expect increases.
- 46% expect >20% of workforce to need reskilling.

[[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025]] empirical correlate: those expected decreases are showing up in the data, **disproportionately at the entry level**, not uniformly across all roles. The McKinsey expectation that AI may not shrink overall headcount (only 8% expect >20% decrease) is consistent with the Brynjolfsson finding that *overall* employment continues to grow.

### Aggregate productivity estimate ([[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|Anthropic Economic Index, 4th report]])

Anthropic's earlier estimate that widespread AI adoption could add **+1.8 pp/yr** to U.S. labor productivity growth is revised in the fourth report once task-level reliability is accounted for:

- **+1.2 pp/yr** for tasks completed on Claude.ai
- **+1.0 pp/yr** for tasks completed on the 1P API (more challenging task mix)

Even +1 pp/yr would return U.S. productivity growth to late-1990s / early-2000s rates. The estimate does not account for further model improvement or for AI use becoming more sophisticated.

### Effective AI coverage at the occupation level ([[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|Anthropic Economic Index, 4th report]])

The fourth Anthropic report introduces **effective AI coverage** — the share of a worker's *time-weighted duties* that Claude could *successfully* perform. Outliers when this is plotted against simple task coverage:

- Effective coverage *exceeds* task coverage: **data entry keyers, radiologists, medical transcriptionists**.
- Effective coverage is *below* task coverage: **teachers, software developers**.

Pooled across all reports through Nov 2025: 49% of jobs have Claude used for at least 25% of their tasks (up from 36% in Jan 2025), but the success-weighted picture is more uneven.

### Task-content shift and deskilling ([[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|Anthropic Economic Index, 4th report]])

A finding distinct from displacement and from wage effects: AI-covered tasks skew toward higher-education content (Claude-covered: 14.4 years average; economy-wide: 13.2 years). As a first-order effect, removing AI-covered tasks from a job *deskills* the remaining task mix on average — shifting it toward lower-education content while the job itself persists. Most-affected named occupations: technical writers, travel agents, teachers. See [[ai-deskilling]] for the dedicated concept page.

### The supply-side answer: durable skills ([[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al. 2026]])

[[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. (2025)]] showed early-career employment declines concentrated in *automation* uses but did not operationalise *which skills* remain valuable for the workers who keep their jobs (or for those entering the labor market). The 2026 [[durable-skills]] literature — anchored by [[2026-05-07-globerson-et-al-scalable-measurement-durable-skills|Globerson et al. (Google Research)]] — provides the supply-side measurement: collaboration, creativity, critical thinking are the canonical examples, and the Vantage / Executive LLM platform makes them measurable at scale (large-N validation; Pearson 0.88 with human experts on creativity assessment).

Together with [[ai-deskilling]], this gives the wiki a complete labor-skill carve:
- **What gets hollowed out:** codified knowledge and procedural tasks (deskilling).
- **What gets retained:** open-ended, socially/contextually situated skills (durable skills).
- **What it implies for the entry-level pipeline:** [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Canaries]] showed the squeeze; [[durable-skills]] shows what training/curriculum/hiring should target if firms want to build their next generation of workers around what AI cannot substitute.

### Productivity gains alongside employment declines

The wiki's primary source for the customer-support productivity finding is now [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond (2025) QJE]] — "Generative AI at Work":

- **+15% productivity** in resolutions per hour (with full year-month + agent + agent-tenure FE: +15.2%).
- **30% gain for less-experienced / lower-skilled workers** with quality also improving.
- Most-experienced / highest-skilled workers: **small speed gains AND small DECLINE in quality** — the equalizing effect is not strictly Pareto-improving.
- AI accelerates the experience curve ~3×: treated 2-month-tenured agents perform like untreated 6+-month-tenured agents.
- Effects are **durable** — workers maintain higher productivity even during AI outages, suggesting the AI is teaching skills rather than just providing real-time scaffolding.

**Reconciling productivity gains with [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|the Canaries paper]] employment declines:** AI raises individual productivity (especially for low-skill workers in a role) while reducing the number of workers needed in that role. Whether net employment goes up or down depends on **demand elasticity** — how much demand expands when costs fall. The customer-support equalizing effect at task level does not imply pro-employment outcomes at occupation level.

The two-paper Brynjolfsson arc is the wiki's clearest illustration of the **task-level vs. occupation-level paradox**: same author, same lab, same methodological rigor, two complementary findings that together are more informative than either alone.

### Skill-biased technological change: high-tenure users gain more ([[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves|Anthropic Economic Index, 5th report]])

The fifth Anthropic Economic Index report (Feb 2026 sample) introduces an explicit **skill-biased technological change** framing — a counterpart to the customer-support equalizing effect, but pointing the other way at the *frontier* of usage:

- **High-tenure Claude users** (those with longer histories of Claude.ai use) report **~3–4 percentage points higher task-success** than lower-tenure users, **after controlling** for task type, model selection, and conversation complexity. The gap survives controls — it is not just about high-tenure users picking easier tasks.
- The mechanism is identified as **learning by doing**: skilled users learn what Claude is good at, structure prompts to reach the model's strengths, choose the right model tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) per task, and recover from failure faster.
- **Model selection itself becomes a skill**. The 5th report shows users select Opus differentially for higher-value tasks: **+1.48 percentage-points higher Opus share per +$10/hour task value** on Claude.ai; **+2.79 pp per +$10** on the 1P API (about twice as steep). High-value-task selection of premium models is a learned behavior visible in usage logs.

Reconciling with [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond (2025)]]'s within-role equalizing effect: the two findings are not contradictory but operate on different populations:

| Setting | Effect direction | Population |
|---|---|---|
| Customer support augmentation (BLR 2025) | **Equalizing** — low-skill +30%, high-skill ~0% | Within-role workers given a fixed AI tool |
| Open-ended Claude usage (AEI 5, 2026) | **Skill-biased** — high-tenure +3–4pp success | Self-selected users across all tasks/models |

The reconciliation: **constrained, single-tool augmentation equalizes**; **open-ended, multi-tool deployment rewards expertise**. As enterprise deployments mature from single-purpose copilots to general-purpose Claude (or multi-model) access, the 5th-report pattern likely dominates over the customer-support pattern. This matters for [[ai-deskilling]] and for [[durable-skills]] in two ways: AI-literacy is becoming a learnable skill with measurable returns, and access to premium models becomes a productivity differentiator alongside underlying competence.

### Hopes outpacing fears: the worker-attitude reversal ([[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham et al. 2024]])

A counterweight finding to the displacement narrative — and the wiki's strongest signal that *current* workers' subjective expectations have *improved*, not worsened, since 2017. From the MIT SMR × BCG 8th-annual survey appendix:

| Attitude (% agree/strongly agree) | 2017 | **2024** |
|---|---:|---:|
| Hope AI will assist with some of my tasks in 5 years | 70% | **84%** |
| Fear AI will assume some of my tasks in 5 years | 31% | **20%** |

Hope rose by 14 pp; fear declined by 11 pp. The report's interpretation: *experience with generative AI may be showing people what these models can — and cannot — do well.* The displacement panic that surged with ChatGPT's release in late 2022 has not been borne out at the worker-attitude level — at least not within the MIT SMR × BCG sample (3,467 respondents, 21+ industries, 136 countries).

**Reconciliation with the [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Canaries paper]]'s 13% relative decline finding**: the two are about *different populations*. Brynjolfsson measures *future hiring* of 22–25-year-olds in AI-exposed occupations; Ransbotham measures *current incumbents'* expectations about themselves. Both can be true: incumbents feel safer than ever, while new entrants find the door narrower than ever. The compositional shift is generational, not subjective.

### The expert-as-evaluator: the durable role under augmentation ([[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026]])

A specific claim about *which* roles retain durable value under sustained AI augmentation: **"The expert as evaluator is not a transitional role."** The mechanism:

- AI compressed *implementation* time dramatically; it did *not* compress the *formation of expertise*.
- Without prior expertise, only two moves exist for an AI output: accept or reject.
- With expertise, a third move opens up: *stay in the encounter and learn.*

Operational implication for hiring and reskilling:

- **Don't deploy AI first in domains where expertise is shallow** — the org loses the evaluator capability that makes compounding possible.
- **Preserve evaluation expertise** as a deliberate capability. Domain experts repositioned as evaluators rather than producers.
- The Polanyi tacit-dimension breach makes *codified* knowledge work more substitutable, but the *evaluation* role becomes more valuable, not less.

This adds a **second** durable-role argument to the wiki, alongside the [[durable-skills]] supply-side measurement of collaboration / creativity / critical thinking. Where Globerson et al. measure individual durable skills *without reference to AI deployment*, Kiron-Schrage make the explicit deployment-context claim: the durable role is **the expert as evaluator of AI outputs**, in domains where the human has prior deep expertise.

### Software developers ages 22–25: -20% from 2024 ([[2026-04-30-ai-index-report-2026|AI Index 2026]])

A 2026 update extending the [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson Canaries]] finding to a more recent timeframe and via a different data path:

- **U.S. software developers ages 22–25: employment fell nearly 20% from 2024**, even as headcount for older developers continued to grow.
- Productivity gains from AI are **14–26%** in customer support and software development — clustered in the same fields where entry-level employment is declining.
- AI agent deployment remains in **single digits** across nearly all business functions, suggesting the employment effect is not driven by full agent replacement but by *augmentation* reducing demand for entry-level labor.

### Crowdsourcing labor markets and HAI substitution ([[2026-04-29-boussioux-crowdless-future|Boussioux et al. 2024]])

A field study comparing **human crowd** (HC, n=125 global Freelancer.com solvers) vs **human-AI** (HAI, single prompt engineer + GPT-4) on a circular-economy ideation challenge finds:

- HC retains a **novelty advantage** (especially at the top decile of solutions).
- HAI delivers **higher strategic viability, environmental value, financial value, and overall quality**.
- Cost: HAI ~**$27** vs HC ~**$2,555** (≈94× cost reduction); time: ~5.5 hours vs ~2,520 human-hours.

This is direct evidence on **substitution dynamics in crowdsourcing labor markets** (Freelancer.com–style platforms): HAI may displace HC for value/quality-oriented tasks while HC retains a comparative advantage on extreme novelty. The paper does not predict full crowd displacement; the authors frame the patterns as complementary, with HAI augmenting early-innovation phases.

### Equalizing effect within elite knowledge workers ([[2026-04-28-dellacqua-jagged-technological-frontier|Dell'Acqua et al. 2026]])

A randomized field experiment with 758 [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]] consultants finds:

- **Bottom-half-skill** AI users (within an already elite professional sample) gain **+31%** on quality scores.
- **Top-half-skill** users gain **+11%** — meaningfully more than zero.

Both groups gain. The pattern echoes the within-occupation equalizing effect documented in [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|customer support]], extended to high-end knowledge work, with the additional finding that top performers are *not* zero-gain in this domain.

### Subjective coherence persists when correctness fails ([[2026-04-28-dellacqua-jagged-technological-frontier|Dell'Acqua et al. 2026]])

Outside-the-[[jagged-frontier|frontier]] AI users produce more confident, more coherent recommendations even when their answers are wrong. This decouples *quality of presentation* from *quality of substance* — a labor-market signal that may mask poor performance from supervisors and clients in the short run.

### Convergence in communication patterns

A specific finding from [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond 2025]] worth flagging: AI access produces **convergence** — low-skill agents begin communicating more like high-skill agents. The mechanism appears to be that the AI, fine-tuned on top performers' conversations, propagates their communication patterns to less-experienced workers.

This adds a **skill-leveling dimension** to AI's labor effects — beyond raw productivity numbers, AI may be reducing within-role skill differentiation. Whether that's good (faster onboarding, lower training costs, better customer experience) or worrying (homogenization, loss of original problem-solving approaches, training-data degradation as top performers reduce their original contributions) is genuinely contested.

## Debates / contradictions

- **The "equalizing effect" vs. employment displacement.** As above — both can be true simultaneously, but the popular reading of "AI helps low-skill workers most" has been over-extended to imply pro-employment outcomes. The Brynjolfsson 2025 paper sharpens that.
- **Are these declines really AI?** [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al.]] are explicit that other factors may be in play. They've ruled out: COVID-era effects, tech-sector contraction, remote-work / outsourcing pressure, firm-level shocks, and education declines from COVID school closures. But they cannot rule out all confounds. Treat as **strong correlational evidence**, not definitive causal proof.
- **Will the equalizing-effect hold at scale?** Robust in early studies (customer support, consulting, software). Open question: as AI tools mature, do high-skill workers eventually catch up by leveraging more sophisticated workflows?
- **Replacement vs. augmentation in the long run.** [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]] notes that the share of orgs predicting workforce *reductions* has *declined* YoY — business leaders are becoming less convinced AI will shrink workforces. Yet Brynjolfsson 2025 shows entry-level employment *is* declining in automation-exposed occupations. Resolution: aggregate workforce expectations remain stable while compositional shifts disadvantage entry-level workers.
- **Geographic and platform effects.** ADP data is U.S.-only; somewhat overrepresents Northeast and manufacturing/services. Whether the Brynjolfsson pattern generalizes to other countries is an open question.
