# Micro-Productivity Trap

A failure pattern in enterprise AI deployment, named in [[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Dutt, Rapoport, Chatterji, Weeratunga & Satcher (2026)]]. Firms invest heavily in AI, treat it as plug-and-play SaaS with isolated use cases, and realize **task-level productivity gains** that **fail to translate into firm-level business value** — because the surrounding workflow still depends on tacit knowledge, manual handoffs, or legacy systems not built for AI.

The framing distinguishes this article's argument from generic "ROI of AI" complaints by giving the failure mode a structural name and two named sub-modes.

## Working definition

> "AI can accelerate a task, but unless companies address workflow bottlenecks, productivity gains may not translate into business value." — [[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Dutt et al. 2026]]

Two specific lock-ins, frequently co-occurring:

| Lock-in | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Offering lock-in** | AI applied to optimize the *existing* product/service rather than reframe what value the firm provides |
| **Process lock-in** | AI applied to automate *current* processes step-by-step rather than rebuild around an outcome |

The escape from the trap is **"reinvent the business"**: an organization-wide, future-focused, outcome-oriented posture that explicitly assumes "we live in a world in which powerful AI tools exist" and rebuilds workflows on that premise.

## Key claims

### Empirical anchor: 10–25% EBITDA gains for the transformation mindset

[[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Bain client work]]: firms that escape the trap and adopt the four-step transformation framework (below) report **10–25% EBITDA gains** that continue to scale as programmes scale.

### The four-step framework for escape

1. **Narrow possibilities strategically** — pick 4–5 critical domains. Top-4 across Bain's portfolio: software development, customer support, knowledge worker efficiency, marketing.
2. **Reimagine workflows across the organization** — process redesign is "the most challenging part of AI deployment" and "creates most of the value." Cross-functional, not silo-by-silo.
3. **Engage those closest to today's process** — top-down + bottom-up; prototyping culture in *all* business areas, not just the tech team.
4. **Measure what matters** — concrete business-outcome metrics with non-AI baselines, *plus* continuous **evals** (evaluation suites for AI behaviour).

### Worked cases

- **[[Lowe's]] + [[OpenAI]] partnership** (Mylow / Mylow Companion, March 2025): >2× online conversion when customers engage Mylow; +200 bps customer satisfaction when associates use Mylow Companion; deployed across 1,700+ stores.
- **FabricationCo** (anonymized Fortune 1000 manufacturer; Bain client): 14 use cases identified, ~$30M additional profit on track; quote-generation **~15× faster**; **+10pp win-rate increase in 3 months**.

### The boardroom imperative

Lagging firms recognize AI as important but **delegate** it to technology groups without specific goals or metrics. The article argues this delegation pattern is a structural cause of the trap — AI transformation requires top-of-house ownership with ambitious, business-owned targets.

### Second-source corroboration: data architecture as load-bearing ([[2026-05-05-nishar-nohria-end-of-one-size-fits-all|Nishar & Nohria 2026]])

Independent of Bain/OpenAI's framing, [[Deep Nishar]] and [[Nitin Nohria]] (HBR.org Digital, April 2026) reach the same conclusion via a different route:

> "Moving quickly is not the same as moving effectively. Organizations that rush to automate without re-architecting their data and processes often find that quality suffers, edge cases accumulate, and systems become difficult to manage. The lesson is not to slow down, but to pair ambition with discipline: to treat data architecture, governance, and ownership as integral to the transformation rather than afterthoughts."

The mechanism Nishar-Nohria name as the trap is the same one Bain/OpenAI named as **process lock-in**: applying [[generative-ai]] to existing workflows without restructuring the data layer or the workflow itself. Their prescription is consistent with the "reinvent the business" posture: **treat data architecture as the foundation**, revisit build-vs-buy per function, govern internally-developed systems, and recognize that software choices are workforce choices.

The two sources together — practitioner consulting (Bain/OpenAI) and practitioner investor + academic (Nishar/Nohria) — converge on **data architecture + process redesign first, technology second** as the load-bearing decision. Source overlap is low (different vantage, different audience), so this is real cross-source agreement, not an echo. Confidence on this concept lifts from single-source 0.70 to two-source 0.75.

### Third-source corroboration: leadership response patterns ([[2026-05-07-carucci-resistance-as-data|Carucci 2026]])

[[Ron Carucci]]'s practitioner essay reframes the trap from a *third* vantage — leadership behavior. His four-category typology of resistance includes a category that maps directly to the operators-see-problems-leaders-dismiss pattern of process lock-in:

> "Sometimes resistance isn't about emotion at all. It's about execution. Employees may see practical issues leaders have overlooked, such as: timelines that aren't realistic, processes that don't match how work actually gets done, conflicts with other ongoing initiatives. But when leaders dismiss resistance too quickly, they also dismiss the possibility that the change itself needs refinement... The very people resisting the change are the ones closest to the risks that could derail it."

Carucci's prescription matches the Bain/OpenAI and Nishar-Nohria diagnoses in spirit but operates at the **leadership-behavior layer** rather than the strategy or transformation-architecture layers:

- **Get curious before you get corrective** — treat pushback as potential insight; ask follow-up questions to understand the operational reality behind the concern.
- **Separate the signal from the delivery** — feedback may come wrapped in frustration or bluntness, but tone shouldn't disqualify content.
- **Be willing to adapt the plan** — strong change efforts evolve.

Three independent sources, three vantages (consulting practice, investor + academic, executive coaching), three vocabularies — all converging on the same point: **the trap is fundamentally a listening failure, not a technology failure**. Confidence lifts from 0.75 (two-source) to 0.80 (three-source agreement across distinct vantages).

### Fourth- and fifth-source corroboration: the operational mechanism ([[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham et al. 2024]] + [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026]])

Two MIT SMR sources from a fourth vantage (academic / journalistic) supply both the **empirical scale** and the **operational mechanism** of the trap.

**Empirical scale**: 3,467-respondent MIT SMR × BCG survey finds **59% of organizations are "Limited Learners"** — low on both organizational learning capability and AI-specific learning capability. Only **15% are Augmented Learners** combining both. The 59% Limited-Learner majority is the empirical correlate of being stuck in the trap; the 15% Augmented-Learner cohort is what escape looks like at population scale.

**Operational mechanism**: [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026]] specify *what process lock-in looks like* in operational detail:

> "Most organizations treat AI outputs as verdicts to be confirmed rather than starting points to be interrogated. The result is **consumption dressed up as adoption — verification mistaken for the whole job.**"

The flywheel that escapes the trap:

| Step | Question | Distinction |
|---|---|---|
| **Verification** | Does this output meet the standard? | Binary, against existing criteria. *Necessary but insufficient.* |
| **Evaluation** | What does this output reveal? | May generate **new** standards. Requires domain expertise. *Where most orgs fail.* |
| **Learning capture** | How do we ensure this insight persists? | Version control for organizational judgment (e.g. CLAUDE.md-style files). |

**Why this matches the Bain/OpenAI diagnosis**: Bain/OpenAI's *process lock-in* (AI automates current processes without redesign) and Nishar-Nohria's *data-architecture-as-afterthought* both name the same trap — applying AI to the *output stage* of a workflow without changing how the organization metabolizes AI's outputs. Kiron-Schrage make the metabolism mechanism explicit: orgs that don't *evaluate* (only verify), don't *capture* (let insights evaporate after each session), or both, never compound.

**Statistical anchor for the operational claim**: orgs that build **systematic feedback loops between humans and AI are 6× more likely** to derive substantial financial benefits; orgs investing in **learning with AI are 73% more likely** to achieve significant financial impact (Ransbotham et al. 2024 cited in Kiron-Schrage 2026).

**Five concrete moves** (from Kiron-Schrage), each correcting a specific failure mode of the trap:

1. **Preserve evaluation expertise** — domain experts repositioned as *evaluators*, not removed because "AI can do that now."
2. **Build minimally viable verification** — start the cycle even when full verification is expensive (multijudge systems, consistency checks).
3. **Institute evaluation practices** — "What worked? What failed? **What was *interestingly* wrong?**" The third question converts AI-output anomalies into surfaced tacit expertise.
4. **Create capture systems** — decision journals, prompt repositories, evaluation logs. *Discipline, not cost or creativity, is the true constraint.*
5. **Measure the cycle, not just the output** — count verifications, evaluations, learning captures, and how quickly captured learning changes practice.

Five independent sources now (Bain/OpenAI, Nishar-Nohria, Carucci, Ransbotham et al., Kiron & Schrage), four vantages (consulting practice, investor/academic, executive coaching, academic survey + practitioner column), all converging. Confidence lifts to **0.85** (five-source agreement; the new sources add the operational mechanism missing from the prior three). The trap is robustly named; what remains is *measurement* — how would an external auditor distinguish a verification-only org from a verify-evaluate-capture org without insider access?

### Sixth- and seventh-source corroboration: agent-harness practitioner essays ([[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]] + [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]])

Two practitioner essays on **[[agent-harness|agent harness]]** engineering, ingested concurrently, supply a *fifth vantage* (working AI engineers / product PMs at the runtime level) that independently arrives at the same operational mechanism the prior five sources named.

[[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]]'s **fourth layer — Compounding** — is operationally identical to Kiron-Schrage's verification → evaluation → learning capture flywheel:

| Kiron-Schrage step | Chatterjee equivalent |
|---|---|
| Verification — does this output meet the standard? | Constraints layer — pre/post-tool hooks score outputs against criteria |
| Evaluation — what does this output reveal? | Contracts layer — formal evaluable specifications, score breakdowns, "your last synthesis scored a C, here is why" |
| Learning capture — how do we ensure this insight persists? | Compounding layer — telemetry as training data for the harness; nightly meta-learning loop proposes harness adjustments; human-reviewed approvals become workspace overrides |

The construct is now visible *both* at the **organizational learning level** (Kiron-Schrage's CLAUDE.md as version control for organizational judgment) and at the **runtime engineering level** (Chatterjee's structured telemetry → harness tuning → workspace overrides). Same mechanism, two scales — strong cross-source convergence.

[[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]] adds the sceptical-vantage corollary: most of the work that escapes the trap is **mature systems engineering** (retries, state machines, idempotency, observability) applied to a new substrate. The 10% genuinely novel — non-determinism at the execution layer + context as a degrading resource — is precisely what *cannot* be solved by checklist; it is where domain expertise and human evaluation are non-substitutable.

**Chatterjee's Friday-in-March story** as the wiki's clearest worked example of the trap's failure mode at the engineering layer: an agent emptied a customer's workspace because the harness lacked an intent-validation layer. *"The model was not the problem. The problem lived in the layer around the model."* Operationally identical to *"verification masquerading as evaluation"* but at a different stack layer — the same diagnostic principle (failures are in the *layer around the model*, not the model itself) generalises.

Seven independent sources now, five vantages (consulting / investor + academic / executive coaching / academic survey + practitioner column / runtime engineering practitioner essays), all converging. **Confidence lifts to 0.90** — among the wiki's most strongly corroborated concepts. What remains genuinely open is *quantitative measurement*: nobody has yet measured the slope of harness-tuning compounding (how much contract-score uplift per unit of telemetry-driven adjustment, over what timeframe). The trap is robustly named *and* its escape mechanism is robustly described; what is missing is *empirical confirmation* that the escape mechanism delivers on its promise at scale.

## Cross-source positioning (descriptive only, per cross-source neutrality)

The micro-productivity-trap framing sits among several wiki vocabularies addressing the same broad territory of "AI adoption breadth ≠ transformation depth":

- [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu's 2×2]] — *where* to deploy GenAI (cost-of-errors × type-of-knowledge).
- [[2026-04-28-werner-lebrun-octopus-organization|Werner & Le-Brun's Octopus / Tin-Man]] — *adaptive vs predictability-optimized* organizational design.
- [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity|MIT CISR Four Stages + Four S]] — *staged maturity* (28%/34%/31%/7% distribution; only 7% Stage 4) and *Strategy / Systems / Synchronization / Stewardship* challenges.
- [[2026-04-28-mittri-cisco-ai-enabled-enterprise|MITTRI/Cisco]] — *chatbot → agent → multi-agent* progression and 5-foundations readiness framework (only 13% AI-ready).
- [[2026-04-28-bansal-birkinshaw-systems-thinking|Bansal & Birkinshaw systems thinking]] — *flows and relationships* over products/services.
- [[2026-04-28-warner-wager-dynamic-capabilities-digital-transformation|Warner & Wäger]] — *digital sensing/seizing/transforming* nine microfoundations under Teece.
- [[2026-05-03-rewired-second-edition-sample|McKinsey "Rewired" 2nd ed (2026)]] — *6 capabilities* (business-led roadmap, talent, operating model, technology, data, adoption-and-scaling); 20% EBITDA uplift / $3:$1 / 1–2yr breakeven across ~20 deep-dive AI-leader companies; 70% talent-density shifts.
- [[2026-04-30-ai-index-report-2026|AI Index 2026]] — empirical context: 88% organizational AI adoption but **AI agent deployment in single digits per business function**.
- [[2026-05-05-nishar-nohria-end-of-one-size-fits-all|Nishar & Nohria 2026]] — *firm-boundary 4-model lens* (Build / Compose / Collaborate / Buy Outcomes); the trap manifests when a firm rushes to "Build" or rushes to automate any layer without first treating **data architecture, governance, and ownership** as the foundation.
- [[2026-05-07-carucci-resistance-as-data|Carucci 2026]] — *human-reaction lens* on the trap; the Flaws-in-change resistance signal is operators surfacing exactly what process lock-in misses; leaders' three traps (personalize / moralize / rush) systematically suppress it.
- [[2026-05-07-ransbotham-augmented-learners|Ransbotham et al. 2024]] + [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron & Schrage 2026]] — *organizational-learning lens* on the trap; 59% of orgs are "Limited Learners" stuck in the trap; the verification → evaluation → learning capture flywheel is the operational machinery to escape it. ROI reframed as **return on iteration**.
- [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]] + [[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane 2026]] — *agent-harness engineering lens* on the trap; the [[agent-harness|agent harness]] is the runtime infrastructure where the trap is escaped or perpetuated. Friday-in-March story makes the failure-mode concrete; "build constraints before you build cleverness" is the operational discipline.
- [[2026-02-09-sternfels-mckinsey-survive-ai-and-reinvent-consulting|Sternfels 2026 (HBR IdeaCast / McKinsey)]] — *consulting-vendor-self-narrative lens* on the trap; the **second consulting firm** (after Bain via [[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|Dutt-Chatterji 2026]]) to name the same diagnosis from inside the engagement: *"Half, if not more, of the secret sauce is organizational change as opposed to technology implementation."* Sternfels' **CFO-vs-CIO truth-room dilemma** captures the trap from the client's seat: *"My CFO is in my ear that we're spending a lot of money on technology, but we're not yet seeing enterprise-level value. ... CIO's saying: this is one of those moments. And if we're not in the lead, we're going to get disrupted."* Two of the world's largest consulting firms converging on identical diagnoses is **structural evidence that the trap is real and pervasive** — not just a Bain framing or a McKinsey framing. Operational escape mechanism Sternfels names: **flatter organizations cutting middle layers** + **workflow consolidation across departmental boundaries** (his mortgage-process worked example: origination + credit-scoring + collection + after-service collapse from 4–5 departments to one AI-enabled flow once the boundaries are removed).
- [[2026-05-06-bockeler-engineering-of-ai-agents-context-harnessing-autonomy|Böckeler 2026 (Thoughtworks at QCon London)]] — *practitioner-consultancy developer-experience lens* on the trap, completing **a three-firm convergence (Bain + McKinsey + Thoughtworks)** from three structurally distinct vantages: client engagement engineering (Bain/OpenAI), global-managing-partner self-narrative (McKinsey), and cross-client developer-tooling observer (Thoughtworks). Böckeler's two contributions: (1) a **token-economics mechanism** for why the trap deepens in 2025–26 — the agentic-coding inner loop (research → plan → review-plan → implement → run tests → fix tests → check lint → fix lint → check browser → code-review subagent → react → summarise) burns $380/day-equivalent tokens for what may be two lines of code, so flat-rate developer tooling has collapsed into metered pricing; (2) the ***Goldilocks speed*** counter-framing — speed pressure without harness investment causes corner-cutting and outages, observable in the report that **Amazon reacted to AI-code-related outages by adding senior-engineer review gateways**, defeating the speed gain. The trap's escape mechanism Böckeler implies: invest in the [[agent-harness]] (feed-forward + feedback, CPU + GPU) *before* dialling autonomy up. Convergent with Sternfels' organizational-change-over-technology framing but at a different stack level — Sternfels at the firm-level operating model, Böckeler at the engineering-team feedback-loop level.
- [[2026-04-24-hu-yc-how-to-build-a-company-with-ai-from-the-ground-up|Hu 2026 (YC Partner / Startup School)]] — *control-systems vocabulary for the trap*. Hu names the trap-escape mechanism in **control-systems terms** that are vendor-neutral and discipline-portable: *"Open loops are inherently lossy. A closed loop, on the other hand, is self-regulating. It continuously monitors its output and adjusts its process to better meet the stated goal."* The wiki's first **formal-systems framing** of the trap: orgs that run open-loop *cannot escape the trap*; orgs that run closed-loop continuously monitor + adjust + improve. Operational instantiation Hu names: *make the company queryable* (record meetings, minimize DMs, embed agents throughout channels, build custom dashboards for everything), *use agents to read the artifacts* (Linear tickets, Slack channels, customer feedback, standup recordings, sales calls), *let the agent propose sprint plans based on what actually shipped vs. customer needs*. **Reported result across multiple YC companies**: *"teams that do this cut their engineering sprint time in half and get close to 10× more done"*. Also names the **productivity-thinking-is-itself-the-trap** insight: *"Most people talk about AI in terms of productivity ... This framing misses the shift we're currently seeing, which is less about productivity boosts than entirely new capabilities."* Convergent with [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron-Schrage 2026]]'s verification → evaluation → learning capture flywheel and with [[2025-05-06-jassy-amazon-agility-ai-strategy-changing-role-of-managers|Jassy 2025]]'s flatten-management initiative, framed in control-systems vocabulary.
- [[2025-05-06-jassy-amazon-agility-ai-strategy-changing-role-of-managers|Jassy 2025 (Amazon CEO on HBR IdeaCast)]] — *target-firm CEO operator-of-trap-escape worked example*. Where Bain / McKinsey / Thoughtworks / NYT describe the trap from observer vantages, Jassy *is* a target-firm CEO actively deploying the trap-escape prescription at Amazon scale. Concrete operational datapoints: **+15% IC-to-manager ratio target** (already beaten in Q1 2025), **1,000+ no-bureaucracy emails received** + **375 processes changed** in response, **5-day RTO mandate** with the explicit hypothesis that *"invention is stronger when people are together"*. Jassy's taxonomic refinement of the trap: *"there is a difference between process and bureaucracy"* — most companies of scale need *process* (legitimate, scaling discipline); the trap-relevant pathology is *bureaucracy* (layers that don't add creative value). The *"two-way-door vs one-way-door"* decision taxonomy is Jassy's named mechanism for delegating decisions to ICs. **Importantly: this is the earliest-published wiki source on the trap (May 2025) — predating both Bain (May 2026) and McKinsey (Feb 2026)** — and is consistent with Jassy *recognising the trap experientially before the consulting-firm vocabulary existed*. Note Jassy's epistemic humility: *"it's very hard to measure how well you're inventing"* — he names his RTO defence as essentially un-measurable, which weakens the per-mechanism evidence even as it strengthens the broader operator-implementing-the-prescription signal. The trap is now visible from **five distinct observer vantages across five sources** (Bain engagement-engineering / McKinsey GMP self-narrative / Thoughtworks consultancy / NYT journalism / **target-firm CEO**) — and the May-2025 anchor extends the trap's temporal footprint backward by ~9 months.
- [[2026-04-14-thompson-the-daily-workers-letting-ai-do-their-jobs|Thompson 2026 (NYT The Daily / 75-developer field-report)]] — *journalist-observer empirical lens*. **Two cleanly-quantified datapoints** crystallise the trap from the developer-side: small two-person startups report up to **~20× faster** delivery (full-day features → ~30 min) with ~100% AI-written code; [[Google]] reports ~**10% overall speedup** despite ~40-50% of code being AI-written. The 2× order-of-magnitude gap *between micro and macro speedup at the same per-task AI penetration level* is the trap's clearest single empirical statement in the wiki. Mechanism named: **organisational metabolism** — change-management overhead, legacy interactions, customer commitments rate-limit how much per-task speed survives into firm-level value. Two further contributions: (1) **the 1980s productivity-paradox parallel** — computers didn't increase corporate productivity until firms reorganised work around them; Thompson predicts AI-coding's industrial impact will be *"longer than we think"* for the same reason; (2) **the hire-back-within-6-months anecdote** — Thompson reports that companies who lay off staff thinking AI will replace them often have to rehire within six months because the replacement didn't work. The trap is now visible at **four distinct empirical scales** (firm, function, team, individual-developer) and from **four distinct observer vantages** (Bain engagement-engineering / McKinsey GMP self-narrative / Thoughtworks consultancy / NYT journalism) — among the wiki's most strongly corroborated patterns. Confidence lifts to the cap (**0.95**).

- [[2026-04-21-forsgren-macvean-build-core-skills-thrive-ai-era-developer|Forsgren & Macvean 2026 (Google I/O / Developer Intelligence team)]] — *engineering-team DORA-grounded vantage on the trap*. The talk explicitly cites the **DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)** research programme — which Forsgren has led since *Accelerate* (2018) — for the trap's most direct engineering-team statement: *"there's some evidence that our DORA team found by studying multiple companies, that **increasing AI adoption can lead to individual productivity benefits while at the same time decreasing team-level benefits.**"* This is the engineering-team correlate of the firm-level trap — individual gains, team-level losses, same divergence mechanism. The talk's three-shift response for engineering leaders maps directly to escape-from-trap practices: (1) **redefine productivity measurement** — *"stop measuring your teams by PR throughput or lines of code accepted"* (the engineering analogue of CFO/CIO metric realignment); (2) **actively protect productive struggle** — protected learning time so engineers build the shared mental models AI-generated code requires (the engineering-team analogue of Carucci's get-curious posture); (3) **foster radical psychological safety** — agentic-workflow experiments must fail without punishment (operationally consistent with Carucci's resistance-as-data framing). The talk also makes the **DORA amplifier-and-mirror** framing explicit: *"AI is an amplifier and a mirror. It magnifies the existing strengths and it holds up a mirror to those weaknesses."* This is the trap's clearest one-line diagnostic — AI doesn't *create* dysfunction, it *exposes and accelerates* dysfunction already present. Convergent with all prior nine framings but operates at the **engineering-team layer** the prior nine did not address directly. The wiki's first vantage that grounds the trap in a longitudinal published research programme (DORA's State of DevOps reports, 2013–present) rather than consulting engagements or single-case observations.

- [[2026-05-05-stanford-ai-club-chamath-on-how-to-win-in-the-ai-era|Chamath 2026 (Stanford AI Club)]] — *operator-anecdotal lens on enterprise-scale trap*. The wiki's most concrete single instance of the trap at the legacy-modernization layer: a $100B/year Fortune-1000 customer brings **COBOL-code retirees back from retirement** to explain what their existing code does, because the current engineering team cannot reconstruct the institutional context. Chamath: *"None of you geniuses were able to figure that out. And nobody before you was able to figure it out. And it turns out that these kinds of problems are the thing that's stopping ROI on trillions of dollars of investment."* The mechanism named: **hidden tribal knowledge as the ROI ceiling** — task-level AI productivity does not aggregate to firm-level value when the *symbolic context* of legacy systems remains inaccessible to the AI agents. Convergent with Thompson's *organisational-metabolism* mechanism but operating at the *institutional-knowledge-archaeology* layer that Thompson does not address. Also a sharper-than-prior framing of the trap's macro implication: *"trillions of dollars … if we don't figure this out, people will hit this trough of disillusionment and say this was a joke"* — explicitly linking the trap's escape to the AI capex trajectory's social-license-to-continue.

Each names the same broad gap with a different vocabulary; the wiki's [[syntheses/organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption|organizational-frameworks-for-ai-adoption]] synthesis maps the cluster (the synthesis was filed when 6 frameworks were ingested; Nishar-Nohria is the 7th, Carucci the 8th, Sternfels the 9th, and Chamath the 10th, at layers the synthesis didn't surface).

## Open questions

- Single-source coverage so far. A second source measuring or naming the same failure pattern (e.g. via McKinsey or a different consultancy/academic vantage) would strengthen the concept.
- Empirical 10–25% EBITDA range is from Bain client work — vendor-of-deployment data, not independent measurement. Independent verification (academic field study, AI Index data) would be a useful counterweight.
