# Agentic Engineering

The **engineering discipline of writing software with AI agents that preserves the quality bar of professional software while going much faster**. Coined explicitly as a paired concept with [[vibe-coding]] by [[Andrej Karpathy]] in the [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Sequoia AI Ascent interview]] (29 April 2026): vibe coding *raises the floor* (everyone can vibe code anything); agentic engineering *raises the ceiling* (professional engineers can ship faster *without* sacrificing quality).

The construct's load-bearing claim: **"the 10× engineer used to be the upper bound; agentic engineering pushes far past 10×"** — implying the productivity distribution gets fatter-tailed, with agentic engineers at the top of it pulling significantly further away. The discipline's day-to-day artifacts are the [[agent-harness]] (the runtime), the spec (the design the human owns), and the agents (the *intern entities* that fill in the blanks).

### Practitioner-side ratification: "harness engineering" as the working-engineer naming

[[2026-05-15-osmani-agent-harness-engineering|Osmani's O'Reilly Radar essay]] (May 2026) introduces **"harness engineering"** as the working-engineer-altitude name for the same discipline Karpathy named *agentic engineering* at paradigm altitude. The wiki holds them as a paired vocabulary: **paradigm-level frame = agentic engineering (Karpathy)**; **practitioner-level discipline = harness engineering (Trivedy, Osmani)**. Osmani's load-bearing rule — **"every line in a good AGENTS.md should be traceable back to a specific thing that went wrong"** (*ratchet, don't brainstorm*) — is the operational test for what *preserves the quality bar at agent speed* actually looks like in a working codebase. The convergence observation Osmani names — *top coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, Cline) look more like each other than their underlying models do* — is the empirical confirmation of agentic engineering's claim that the discipline is more load-bearing for outcomes than the model is.

## Working definition

[[Andrej Karpathy]] in the [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Sequoia AI Ascent interview]]:

> *"Agentic engineering when I call it that, because I do think it's kind of like an engineering discipline. You have these agents which are these spiky entities — they're a bit fable, a little bit stochastic, but they are extremely powerful. How do you coordinate them to go faster without sacrificing your quality bar? Doing that well and correctly is the realm of agentic engineering."*

**Key contrast with [[vibe-coding|vibe coding]]:**

| Dimension | [[vibe-coding\|Vibe coding]] | Agentic engineering |
|---|---|---|
| Effect on the productivity distribution | Raises the floor (everyone) | Raises the ceiling (professionals) |
| Trade-off | Speed and accessibility | **Speed *without* sacrificing quality** |
| Audience | Hobbyists, non-engineers, side-project builders | Production engineers |
| Karpathy's verdict on ceiling | "Amazing, incredible" — democratisation | *"People who are very good at this peak a lot more than 10×"* |
| Quality requirement | Not load-bearing | *"You're not allowed to introduce vulnerabilities. You're still responsible for your software just as before."* |

The wiki holds these as **two complementary modes of the same Software 3.0 substrate**, not opposites.

## Architectural relationship to other constructs

- **Substrate**: [[software-3.0]] — agentic engineering is the disciplined practice of writing Software 3.0 programs at production-quality bar. Vibe coding is the same substrate without the quality bar.
- **Operational vehicle**: [[agent-harness]] — the runtime that wraps the model with context management, constraints, contracts, and compounding telemetry. *Most of the day-to-day work of an agentic engineer is harness work* (per [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]]).
- **Workforce**: [[ai-agents]] — *intern entities* (Karpathy's framing) that fill in the blanks once the human has specified the design.

The construct's sharpest single-line synthesis (across [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]] + [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Karpathy 2026]]):

> Agentic engineering is to the harness what software engineering is to the IDE — the discipline that uses the tooling to ship reliable systems.

[[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]] names the *artifact* (the harness — what you build); [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Karpathy 2026]] names the *practice* (agentic engineering — what you do).

## Key claims

### The ceiling pushes far past 10×

> *"People used to talk about the 10× engineer previously. I think that this is magnified a lot more. 10× is not the speed-up you gain. People who are very good at this peak a lot more than 10×."* — [[Andrej Karpathy]]

The claim is structural, not just rhetorical: in a Software 3.0 paradigm, the engineer who can articulate a clean spec, structure an effective harness, design quality contracts, and review agent output skilfully **multiplies their leverage** in a way that the old "fast typist who knows the language" 10× engineer didn't.

### Humans own design; agents own fill-in-the-blanks

The vivid Karpathy debugging anecdote (his Menu Gen agent associating Stripe and Google accounts by *email match*):

> *"There wasn't a persistent user ID. It was trying to match up the email addresses, but you could use different emails for your Stripe and your Google and basically would not associate the funds. Why would you use email addresses to crossorelate the funds? They can be arbitrary."*

The architectural error (using non-persistent identifiers for cross-system reconciliation) is exactly the kind of thing a senior engineer catches in design review — and exactly the kind of thing an agent confidently produces and ships. The implication for the discipline:

- **Humans own**: aesthetics, judgment, taste, oversight, the spec/plan, the **architectural decisions** (*"these have to be unique user IDs"*).
- **Agents own**: the **fill-in-the-blanks** — API details, syntax variations (*"keep_dims vs keepdim, axis vs dim, reshape vs permute vs transpose — I don't remember this stuff anymore. You don't have to."*).

This is operationally consistent with [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]]'s *Constraints* layer (pre-tool / post-tool middleware that catches what intent the model is *actually* expressing). The Karpathy email-matching bug is a textbook case of a missing intent-validation hook.

### Spec-first, not plan-mode

> *"I actually don't even like the plan mode. I would, I mean, obviously it's very useful, but I think there's something more general here — work with your agent to design a spec that is very detailed and maybe basically the docs, and then get the agents to write them and you're in charge of the oversight and the top-level categories, but the agents are doing a lot of the under the hood."* — [[Andrej Karpathy]]

The substance: planning shouldn't be a *mode toggle in the UI* — it should be a **collaborative spec-design step that produces persistent docs the agent then implements against.** This is operationally close to what the wiki's [[agent-harness]] *Contracts* layer ([[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]]) does: a formal evaluable specification of "successful output" calibrated to the inputs available. Karpathy's framing emphasises that **the spec is also the docs** — same artifact, different consumers.

### Tool mastery is the new craft

> *"I think it's just trying to get the most out of the tools that are available — utilising all of their features, investing into your own setup. Just like previously all the engineers used to basically getting the most out of the tools they use, either it's vim or VS Code or now it's Claude Code or Codex."* — [[Andrej Karpathy]]

Implication: a 2026 engineer's "tool stack" (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Anti-gravity, OpenCode, etc. — same model behind each; **different harnesses**) is the load-bearing skill. Per [[2026-05-04-rethinking-agents-harness-is-all-you-need|the empirical-anchor video]], the same model produces 6× variance across these tools — so tool selection and mastery is not a peripheral skill, it's central to the discipline.

### Hiring is still broken (and the proposed fix)

> *"What I'm seeing is that most people have still not refactored their hiring process for agentic engineering capability. If you're giving out puzzles to solve, this is still the old paradigm."* — [[Andrej Karpathy]]

Karpathy's proposed alternative interview format:

> *"Hiring has to look like 'give me a really big project and see someone implement that big project — let's write a Twitter clone for agents, make it really good, make it really secure, then have some agents simulate some activity, then I'm going to use 10 Codex 5.4× for X-high to try to break it. They should not be able to break it.'"*

The shape: **project-scale, build-and-defend, adversarial-test-by-agent-fleet.** This format directly tests the engineer's ability to:

- Specify a complex artifact at the right level of detail.
- Direct agents to fill in the blanks.
- Build constraints (per [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]]'s harness Constraints layer) that hold under adversarial pressure.
- Review and reject low-quality agent output.

It is not testing what the old algorithm-puzzle interviews tested.

## Practitioner observations

### What good agentic engineers do differently

From [[Andrej Karpathy]]'s answer to *"how would you describe the difference between mediocre and AI-native coders"*:

- **Invest in their own setup**: tool configuration, custom skills, project templates, harness tuning.
- **Use all the features** of the tools (not just chat-completion mode; full agentic loops with tool-use, file-edit-with-diff, multi-file context).
- **Iterate on prompts and skills**: their CLAUDE.md / repo-level skill files are continuously refined.
- **Coordinate fleets**: per [[2026-05-07-kiron-schrage-compound-benefits|Kiron-Schrage 2026]] (Boris Cherny's 10–15 concurrent Claude instances), top operators are running parallel agents, not single sequential ones.

### What separates agentic engineering from "AI-assisted development"

The distinction is not about *how much* AI is used — it's about *who owns what*:

| Layer | AI-assisted development (older framing) | Agentic engineering (Karpathy 2026) |
|---|---|---|
| Specification | Human writes; AI helps polish | Human writes (collaboratively with agent); becomes the docs |
| Implementation | Human writes; AI suggests completions | Agent writes; human reviews and rejects |
| Code review | Human reviews other humans | Human reviews agent output; agent fleet reviews other agent output |
| Adversarial testing | QA team runs scenarios | Agent fleet attempts to break the artifact |
| Tool mastery | Optional sophistication | **Load-bearing** core skill |

The *symbolic-space-above-the-embedding-space* construct generalises Karpathy's *"the spec is the design the human owns"* claim: at enterprise scale, the spec is the *entire institutional symbolic representation* — not just per-feature acceptance criteria, but the firm's complete legible logic |

Closes the loop: agentic-engineering as a discipline is now visible *both* as the internal-team practice that builds frontier AI products *and* as the external-company practice that builds AI-native customer products at scale.

## Operational invariants from the Codex case study

[[2026-02-11-lopopolo-codex-harness-engineering|Lopopolo 2026]] surfaces a cluster of operational invariants worth naming as a checklist for agentic-engineering practice — distilled from the Codex team's five-month experience:

- **Repository-as-system-of-record.** *"From the agent's point of view, anything it can't access in-context while running effectively doesn't exist."* Every architectural rule, design decision, taste invariant, and acceptance criterion belongs in repo-local versioned markdown. Knowledge in Slack, docs, or people's heads is *illegible*.
- **AGENTS.md as table of contents, not encyclopedia.** Progressive disclosure: ~100-line top-level map with pointers to deeper sources, each with verification status, ownership, freshness checks, and mechanical lints. Monolithic instruction files fail predictably (context scarce / too much guidance becomes non-guidance / rots / hard to verify).
- **Layered architecture, mechanically enforced.** Forward-only dependency direction within domains; cross-cutting concerns route through one explicit interface (Lopopolo's Providers). Custom linters enforce. *"This is the kind of architecture you usually postpone until you have hundreds of engineers. With coding agents, it's an early prerequisite."*
- **Throughput inverts the merge philosophy.** Minimal blocking gates; PRs short-lived; flakes addressed with follow-up runs. *"In a system where agent throughput far exceeds human attention, corrections are cheap, and waiting is expensive."*
- **Encode taste as mechanical rules, not Friday cleanups.** Human-taste corrections become either (a) doc updates the agent reads, or (b) custom lint rules the agent's commits must pass. *"Human taste is captured once, then enforced continuously on every line of code."*
- **Garbage-collection as background workload.** Codex replicates patterns including suboptimal ones; entropy creeps in. Background scheduled tasks scan for deviations and open targeted refactoring PRs, mostly auto-merged. *"Technical debt is like a high-interest loan: better to pay it down continuously."*
- **Make the application legible to the agent.** UI legibility (Chrome DevTools Protocol so Codex can take DOM snapshots / screenshots / validate UI behaviour); observability legibility (per-worktree LogQL/PromQL/TraceQL). The harder you make application-state legible, the more leverage the agent gets.
- **Hire for taste in environment design, not coding-puzzle speed.** *"Building software still demands discipline, but the discipline shows up more in the scaffolding rather than the code."* Operationally consistent with [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Karpathy's]] hiring-refactor argument.

These are not *additions* to Karpathy's discipline definition — they're the **operational instantiation** in one production environment. Other vendor case studies will likely vary specifics; the *invariants* (legibility, encoded taste, mechanically-enforced boundaries, GC-as-workload) are the candidates for cross-org generalization.

## The eval-discipline counterpart ([[2026-05-18-wolfe-agent-evaluation-detailed-guide|Wolfe 2026]])

[[2026-05-18-wolfe-agent-evaluation-detailed-guide|Wolfe's *Agent Evaluation: A Detailed Guide*]] (Deep (Learning) Focus, 18 May 2026) is the wiki's first source whose primary contribution is the **eval-side counterpart** to the engineering-side rule-set above. Where [[2026-05-15-osmani-agent-harness-engineering|Osmani 2026]] gives *how to build the harness carefully* and [[2026-02-11-lopopolo-codex-harness-engineering|Lopopolo 2026]] gives *what production looks like*, Wolfe gives *how to measure whether the engineering actually works*. The 7-step roadmap (define success → small task set → useful tasks → ground truth → graders → eval harness → inspect-iterate-maintain) is the eval-side ratchet — *eval suites are living artifacts that continually improve in difficulty, diversity, and reliability*. The corollary closes the discipline loop: **agentic engineering without measurement is unmeasurable; agentic engineering with measurement compounds.** Wolfe explicitly recommends using the production scaffold as the eval scaffold — the same artifact serves both disciplines, which is what makes them mutually reinforcing rather than two separate efforts.

## The AWS-vendor-altitude working definition ([[2026-05-21-allen-aws-london-exec-forum-agentic-team-structures|Allen / AWS London Exec Forum 2026]])

Jonathan Allen's keynote at the AWS London Executive Forum 2026 gives the wiki its **tightest single-line vendor-altitude restatement** of what an agentic system is (~3:09): *"an agentic system is fundamentally a prompt with context or the ability to pull tools in that's hitting a language model."* This is structurally identical to the [[agent-harness|harness]]-wrapping-a-foundation-model definition the wiki has held since the [[2026-04-29-andrej-karpathy-from-vibe-coding-to-agentic-engineering|Karpathy 2026]] anchor; the value of Allen's restatement is the *vendor-altitude framing* and the empirical anchor it carries: *~80% of AWS customers currently building agentic systems are choosing to compose against a frontier model rather than fine-tune their own* — which means **agentic-engineering practice in production today is primarily harness-composition discipline against rented frontier models**, not custom-model engineering.

Allen pairs the definition with the AWS-vendor-altitude operating-model corollary at ~26:30: *"in agentic AI systems, non-determinism is a feature, not a bug."* The wiki's [[software-3.0|Software 3.0]] paradigm holds this as foundational; Allen's contribution is to name the **enterprise-operating-model implication** — *"if you still have engineering and operations as two different things, you are going to struggle with agentic systems. Runbooks are deterministic. Agents are not. Ticket culture kills the context."* The [[2026-05-08-running-an-ai-native-engineering-org|Fung / Anthropic]] talk's identical claim (*"the tool isn't the hard part... your processes are"*) is the vendor-channel-parity anchor.

## The developer-tooling-vendor instantiation: Agent HQ + the four VS Code modes ([[2025-12-22-randell-gousset-microsoft-agentic-devops-in-real-life|Randell & Gousset / Microsoft Dec 2025]])

The [[GitHub]]/[[Microsoft]] *Agentic DevOps* keynote shows what agentic-engineering *primitives* look like once a tooling vendor productises them. **Agent HQ** ([[GitHub]], announced at GitHub Universe) is an explicit harness-orchestration surface: monitor, **steer an active agent session mid-run**, and audit past runs — and via its **open architecture**, run the [[OpenAI]] Codex agent (with [[Anthropic|Claude]] and [[Google|Gemini]] agents following) from inside one IDE under one license. The keynote's **four VS Code Copilot modes — Ask / Edit / Agent / Plan** — are a clean ladder of escalating autonomy, with **Plan mode** (the agent states its implementation plan *before* acting) added specifically to counter the *"if we give the agent too much autonomy, sometimes bad things happen"* failure mode. Instructions files encode house rules + **exemplars** (the keynote's term for the same *"here's how we do something in our application"* baseline the wiki tracks as RAG-style context-injection). This is the **developer-tooling-vendor altitude** on the [[agent-harness|harness]]-composition discipline — the same *non-determinism-is-a-feature / processes-are-the-hard-part* thesis Allen (AWS) and Fung (Anthropic) name above, now expressed as shipping IDE features. The keynote also extends agentic engineering *past coding* into IT-ops via the **Azure SRE Agent** (autonomous monitoring + permissioned remediation), and supplies the wiki's clearest vendor statement of the collaboration spectrum: **human-in-the-loop / on-the-loop / out-of-the-loop**, with the presenters using nothing fully out-of-the-loop.

## Debates and supersession

- **Is "engineering discipline" the right framing, or is it just "advanced tool-use"?** Karpathy's claim is that it's a discipline; [[2026-05-07-kokane-agent-harness-vs-systems-design|Kokane]] would push back that 90% of it is mature systems engineering rebranded. Both can be true — the *discipline* is real *and* its primitives are mature systems engineering applied to a new substrate.
- **Does the 10× → "much more than 10×" ceiling claim hold under measurement?** The wiki has not yet ingested an empirical study of agentic-engineer productivity distributions. Worth tracking.
- **Is the multiplier conditional on existing skill, or unconditional?** [[2026-03-23-wu-an-yc-momentic-qa-layer-ai-coding-era|Wu / Momentic 2026]] argues *"Codex only makes you a 10x engineer if you weren't a 10x engineer to begin with"* — a direct rhetorical inversion of [[2026-05-20-tan-hu-stanford-cs153-ai-native-company-1000x-engineer|Tan & Hu / CS153 2026]]'s unconditional *1,000× engineer* framing. Filed as productive contradiction: both founders may be right at different conditionalities — Tan & Hu describe what *the best* engineer can now do unconditionally (the 5-day Posterous rebuild as worked example); Wu describes what *Codex deployed on the average engineer* produces. The wiki carries both anchors without resolving — adaptability, ambiguity-navigation, curiosity, and passion as meta-skills (Wu's framing) are not in tension with the unconditional-headline figure (Tan & Hu's framing) when the latter is read as *what the top of the distribution becomes capable of*.
- **Is the discipline transferable across domains?** Karpathy's worked examples are all coding (Menu Gen, Twitter-clone interview, micro-GPT). The discipline should generalise to non-code domains (research synthesis, data analysis, design) — but that hasn't been tested at scale yet in the wiki's source corpus.

## Related concepts

- [[software-3.0]] — the substrate; agentic engineering is the disciplined practice of writing Software 3.0 programs at production quality.
- [[vibe-coding]] — the floor-raising counterpart; same substrate, different goals.
- [[agent-harness]] — the operational vehicle of the discipline.
- [[ai-agents]] — the workforce (*intern entities*).
- [[jagged-frontier]] — agentic engineers must know which RL circuits their work is in (verifiable + labs-cared-about → fly; otherwise → struggle).
- [[foundation-models]] — the interpreter; "rented from a vendor whose competitor will outperform them within the year" per [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee 2026]]; agentic engineering's value compounds across model upgrades.
- [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] — the organisational context in which agentic engineering becomes a hireable role.

## Open questions

- **Empirical measurement of the ceiling lift.** Karpathy's "much more than 10×" is rhetorical; a 2026–27 controlled study would settle whether it generalises.
- **Domain transfer.** Does agentic engineering as a discipline generalise to research synthesis, design, scientific work, etc., or is the coding-centric framing load-bearing?
- **Hiring-process refactor.** Karpathy says most companies haven't refactored hiring; if a second source documents companies that *have* (Anthropic? Cursor?), that's worth ingesting.
- **The aesthetics gap.** Karpathy specifically says current agent code is "bloaty, awkward abstractions, brittle." If this gap closes, do agentic engineers spend less time on review and more on spec/design? Worth tracking.
- **"Tool mastery is the new craft"** — does this generalise across model families, or is it specific to the current Claude Code / Cursor / Codex tool generation? If a tool-vendor consolidation happens (one wins, others fade), the "craft" specialises into mastery of one tool rather than navigation across many.
