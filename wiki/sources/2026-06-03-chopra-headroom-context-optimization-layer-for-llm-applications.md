# Headroom: A Context Optimization Layer for LLM Applications — Tejas Chopra (Netflix)

> LLM tokens are expensive. With context windows expanding to 200K+ tokens, a single API call can cost several dollars, and in production systems handling thousands of requests, these costs compound quickly. Most optimization efforts focus on model selection or prompt engineering, but the context itself often contains massive redundancy. Headroom is an open-source Python library that sits between your application and your LLM provider, transparently optimizing context before it reaches the model… Headroom introduces novel concepts such as reversible compression, cache aligners, compression routers, and even persistent memory. Real-world results: 50-90% token reduction on typical agentic workloads; drop-in integrations for LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible provider; zero code changes required when using the proxy server.

A **~41-minute conference talk** by **Tejas Chopra** (senior engineer, [[Netflix]]; his day job is the data-storage layer behind Netflix recommendations) at a Linux Foundation open-source conference. It presents **[Headroom](https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom)** — an open-source (Python; Rust port in progress) **context-optimization proxy** that sits between an agent and its LLM provider and transparently compresses context. The wiki's first source that is a **concrete, shipping implementation of the [[agent-harness|harness]] Context layer** rather than a taxonomy of it — and its first source authored by a Netflix engineer.

Where [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee]] *names* the four harness layers (Context / Constraints / Contracts / Compounding) and [[2026-05-04-rethinking-agents-harness-is-all-you-need|Prompt Engineering's OS analogy]] casts the **context window as RAM** the harness manages, Headroom is the operating detail of *how you actually manage that RAM* — cache-hit preservation, per-type compression, and reversible eviction with on-demand retrieval. It is the Context layer at the level of code that ships, with **1,900 GitHub stars and 30+ contributors in four months.**

## TL;DR

- **The problem is context bloat, not prompt verbosity.** Most token-compression literature targets the *user prompt*; but in agentic/coding workflows ~90% of the budget is tool outputs — whole log files pulled into context, verbose JSON arrays (80% waste), web-page DOMs, arxiv papers. "Most of the agent's token budget is really noise."
- **Headroom is a local proxy** (`pip install`, `headroom wrap claude`/`wrap codeex`) between agent and model. **No data leaves your box.** Six compressors, four deploy modes, MCP server.
- **Three stages.** (1) **Cache aligner** — moves dynamic fields (dates, UUIDs) out of the cacheable prefix and toward the end, so a single per-session change doesn't bust the whole prefix cache. (2) **Content router** — different compressors per data type (AST-based for code, JSON "smart crusher," DOM for web). (3) **CCR (Compress-Cache-Retrieve)** — reversible compression: squash a payload, embed a marker + ID, and register an MCP `retrieve` tool so the LLM can fetch the original on demand. Backed by local Redis + SQLite, 5-min TTL.
- **Reversible compression** is the core idea: compress aggressively, but inject a tool-call escape hatch. In practice "**99% of the time the LLM doesn't call** because it finds its answers elsewhere." A learning loop compresses *less* next time when a retrieve fires.
- **Cache mechanics are the hidden cost lever.** KV/prefix caching means the *entire* appended message array is re-sent each turn; providers charge ~10% on cache hits but penalize the *whole window* on any change. Provider discounts: **Anthropic 90%** (`cache_control` tags, set automatically by Headroom), **OpenAI 50%** (automatic), **Google 75%** (flaky). Claude's default prefix-cache TTL is **5 minutes** (and a forked sub-agent has its own cache, silently burning your 5 min); a hidden **1-hour TTL** exists but costs **2× on writes for 90% read savings** — the right choice depends on coding style.
- **compress-base** — Chopra's own **encoder-only** model (not a summarizer): it weighs each token and decides keep/remove. Trained on **agentic traces** rather than Microsoft **LLMLingua's** meeting-summary corpus. Open source; "not the best model, honestly," v2 planned.
- **Results**: typical users save **20–30%** (function of tool-call volume); best-case JSON compression **83–95%**; a 190-page 10-K compressed **34%** with accuracy preserved. **200B tokens saved (~$700K)** via opt-in tokens-only telemetry — a floor.
- **Beyond cost: latency and accuracy.** A voice-agent user uses Headroom to cut the LLM middle-phase latency toward the **~200ms human-perceptible threshold** (voice agents typically ~300ms). And because accuracy degrades as context grows (**"context rot"**), compressing what enters the window *improves* accuracy, not just cost.
- **Memory mode** bridges memory across agents: a SQLite graph of one session's memory synced to `agent.md`/`memory.md` so a different agent (Claude Code → Codex) inherits it — a lightweight local analogue of [[2026-05-08-bratanic-unified-agentic-memory-hooks|Bratanic's cross-harness memory via hooks]].
- **Roadmap**: per-domain compressors (financial, medical), image/video (a factory-glasses user cut Claude video-upload cost from **$3 → $0.20**), and **Headlight** — a forthcoming open-source **context-provenance + agent-consumable telemetry** project, on the thesis that "a year out, agents will consume telemetry data," so observability output should be token-efficient for agents, not humans.

## What was actually ingested

Full ~41:11 transcript (ASR-cleaned: speaker name *Tjis/Tahas → Tejas*; *clot/clock code → Claude Code*; *codeex → Codex*; *OpenClaw/open code → OpenCode*; *Reddus → Redis*; *LLM Lingua → LLMLingua*; etc.). No YouTube chapters; section headings inferred. Numbers are author-reported (GitHub stars, 200B-tokens/$700K telemetry floor, 20–30% typical / 83–95% best-case compression, $3→$0.20 video case) — no independent verification. Slides not captured. The tool name rendered **"RTK"** is ASR-uncertain.

## Key claims, with quotes

### The problem is in the tool outputs, not the prompt

> *"Most of the literature on token compression has been focused on user-prompt compression … But 90% of my coding workflow involves anything but the user prompt. There are local reads to code files, external tool calls, web pages, arxiv papers being read. One-size-fits-all will not work here."*

This relocates the optimization target from prompt-engineering to **context engineering** — the same move the [[agent-harness|harness]] literature makes when it says the model is commodity and the runtime around it is the moat. Headroom is the Context-layer instrument for it.

### Reversible compression + retrieve-on-demand

> *"You compress something but inject information to the LLM saying that if you need more, here is a tool call you can make … if the LLM wants the original context back because you compressed too aggressively, it can make a tool call and fetch it."*

CCR (Compress-Cache-Retrieve) is a **retrieval pattern grafted onto compression**: evict aggressively, keep the original in local Redis/SQLite, expose an MCP `retrieve` tool with an embedded ID. It is structurally adjacent to RAG's retrieve-when-needed logic but applied to *the agent's own prior context* rather than an external corpus — a useful data point for the wiki's [[syntheses/is-rag-dead|is-RAG-dead]] question (retrieval doesn't disappear; it moves inside the harness's context manager). "99% of the time the LLM doesn't call because it doesn't need it."

### Cache-hit preservation is a first-class harness job

> *"If your system prompt contains a date field or a UUID that changes per session, you're effectively getting a cache miss every single time. That will blow up your costs. The cache aligner … extracts dynamic fields, takes them out, and puts them toward the end so you still get a cache hit for a majority of your session."*

This is the operational detail behind the harness definition's *"structured document with stable (KV-cacheable) and dynamic parts"* ([[agent-harness]] working definition). Headroom automates the stable/dynamic partition that the harness literature names abstractly — plus the provider-specific discount mechanics (Anthropic `cache_control` 90%, OpenAI 50%, Google 75%; Claude's 5-min vs hidden 1-hour TTL).

### Per-type compressors + an encoder-only token-weigher

> *"You need different compressors per type of data … We use AST-based compressors for code, JSON compressors for JSON, a DOM compressor for web pages."*

> *"LLMLingua was trained on meeting summaries, which don't represent coding-agent work, so I trained my own compress-base on agentic traces … It's an encoder-only model — it doesn't generate text, it weighs each token and decides if presence or absence impacts the output."*

The content-router + compress-base design is the concrete answer to *what a Context-layer compressor actually does* — and the LLMLingua-vs-agentic-traces point is a small but real claim that **domain-of-training matters for context compression**, foreshadowing the per-domain (financial/medical) roadmap.

### Compression buys latency and accuracy, not just cost

> *"When you compress tokens you're not [only] saving money — you're saving latency and you're saving accuracy … as context windows grow, accuracy drops significantly."*

The **context-rot** claim (accuracy degrades with context length) is the quality-side rationale for context optimization, independent of cost — and the voice-agent latency case (toward the ~200ms human-perceptible floor) is the wiki's first concrete latency-motivated harness-component deployment.

### Telemetry for agents, not humans (Headlight)

> *"Most observability today — OpenTelemetry, OpenLLMetry — is built for humans to consume. But a year out, agents will consume telemetry data, so the telemetry output should be token-efficient for agents to use."*

A forward-looking claim worth tracking: **context provenance** ("what entered the context window and from where") as a harness-layer concern that "cannot live in a foundation model," plus agent-consumable (token-efficient) telemetry — an emerging adjacency to the [[agent-harness|Compounding]] layer.

## Cross-source positioning

|---|---|---|
| [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness\|Chatterjee 2026]] | Harness 4 layers (Context / Constraints / Contracts / Compounding) | A **shipping implementation of the Context layer** — cache aligner + content router + CCR are the Context layer at code-that-ships granularity. |
| [[2026-05-04-rethinking-agents-harness-is-all-you-need\|Prompt Engineering 2026]] | OS analogy: context window = RAM, harness = OS | Headroom is **RAM management**: cache-hit preservation, per-type compression, eviction-with-retrieval — exactly the OS's memory-management job. |

## Linked entities and concepts

**Existing pages (touched or referenced):**

- [[agent-harness]] — heavy: Headroom is a concrete Context-layer implementation; cache aligner / content router / CCR / 11 hooks / cross-agent memory all map onto the harness anatomy.
- [[ai-agents]] — moderate: agentic workflows, tool calls, MCP retrieve tool.
- [[foundation-models]] — moderate: KV cache, prefix caching, context windows, provider cache economics.
- [[LangChain]] — light: a named drop-in integration target (compress command for LangChain/Agno pipelines).
- [[Anthropic]] / [[OpenAI]] — light: Claude/Codex are the primary harnesses Headroom wraps; provider cache-discount mechanics described.
- [[syntheses/is-rag-dead|is-rag-dead]] / [[syntheses/knowledge-architectures-for-llm-agents|knowledge-architectures-for-llm-agents]] — light: CCR as in-harness retrieval; cross-agent memory as a knowledge-architecture pattern.

**Dangling (single-source mention, deferred per CLAUDE.md author-entity promotion rule):**

- *Tejas Chopra* — speaker / Headroom author (senior engineer, Netflix). Promote on second-source mention.
- *Netflix* — Chopra's employer; many internal teams reportedly use Headroom. Likely promotion candidate on a second Netflix-related source.
- *Headroom* — the open-source library (the source's subject). Candidate product/library entity on a second mention.

**Promoted to entity (2026-06-08):** [[The Linux Foundation]] — this talk's channel/host now joins the two *State of Tech Talent* reports ([[2026-05-01-lf-state-of-tech-talent-global-2026|Global]], [[2026-06-01-lf-state-of-tech-talent-europe-2026|Europe]]) as the foundation's third wiki source, crossing the promotion threshold.
- *Headlight* — forthcoming sibling project (context provenance); *compress-base* — Chopra's encoder-only compression model; *LLMLingua* — Microsoft text-compression baseline; *RTK* / *LeanCTX* — prior-art compression tools (RTK ASR-uncertain); *Agno* — agent framework named as an integration target. Track if any recur.

## Source-quality flag

- **Strengths**: a rare **shipping-code** vantage on the harness Context layer (most wiki harness sources are taxonomies or essays); concrete mechanisms (cache aligner, content router, CCR, encoder-only compress-base) with provider-specific cache economics that are otherwise buried in docs; real adoption signal (1,900 stars, 30+ contributors, Netflix internal use); broadens the harness cluster from *what/why* to *how*.
- **Caveats**: vendor/author talk for an open-source tool the speaker built and is promoting; all numbers author-reported (no independent benchmark); the headline "50–90% reduction" (description) is materially higher than the "20–30% typical" stated on stage — read the 50–90% as best-case; eval/accuracy story is explicitly immature ("we don't have a good story there" on drift); ASR transcript with one uncertain tool name (RTK).
- **Per CLAUDE.md §Lifecycle**: baseline 0.70 (single supporting source for the specific Headroom mechanisms) + 0.05 for strong cross-source resonance with the harness cluster (Chatterjee Context layer; OS-analogy RAM; Bratanic memory/hooks; Anthropic compaction). Single conference talk by an interested party → held at **0.75**.

## Open questions for the wiki

- **Is there a "context engineering" concept page waiting to be born?** Headroom, Chatterjee's Context layer, the OS-analogy RAM framing, and the context-rot accuracy claim are converging on *context management as a discipline distinct from prompt engineering*. If a second source frames it as a named discipline, consider promoting a `context-engineering` concept page.
- **CCR vs RAG.** The retrieve-on-demand-over-evicted-context pattern is a data point for [[syntheses/is-rag-dead|is-rag-dead]]; worth folding in if a second source describes in-harness retrieval over prior context.
- **Headlight / context provenance.** Track the forthcoming project — provenance + agent-consumable telemetry is a candidate extension of the harness Compounding layer.
- **Second Netflix / Tejas Chopra source** would promote the dangling entities and let the wiki triangulate the Netflix-engineering vantage.
