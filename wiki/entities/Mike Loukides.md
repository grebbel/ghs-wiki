# Mike Loukides

VP of Content Strategy at [[O'Reilly Media]] and editorial lead of **O'Reilly Radar**. Author and curator of the monthly *Radar Trends to Watch* digest — a six-section, ~30-item editorial roundup of the prior month's tech news, with explicit emphasis on threads expected to compound (agents, MCP, harnesses, security, infrastructure, design). Long-time technical editor (Unix system programming, data science, AI books). Quoted by [[Julie Baron]] in [[2026-01-09-baron-signals-for-2026|Signals for 2026]] on the *"signs of the future in the present"* signal-detection framing.

The wiki promoted Loukides to entity status in the **16 May 2026 batch ingest** that landed all five of his Jan–May 2026 *Radar Trends* digests plus three other O'Reilly Radar articles. Loukides is the wiki's first *recurring-digest curator* entity — his editorial weighting itself counts as a signal worth citing, distinct from any individual item in the digest.

## Editorial moves the wiki has tracked

- **Genre shift in [[2026-04-07-loukides-radar-trends-april-2026|April 2026]]**: from chronicling toward signal-detection. *"News from the future"* framing via William Gibson. Adopts scenario-planning language compatible with [[2026-04-28-webb-strategic-foresight|Webb's strategic-foresight methodology]].
- **AI co-authorship in [[2026-05-05-loukides-radar-trends-may-2026|May 2026]]**: Claude added as named co-author. **First time the digest carries an explicit human-AI co-byline** — transparency from the publisher about AI-assisted curation.
- **Recurring threads**: agent harnesses / MCP / Skills / OpenClaw / agent-runtimes-becoming-HaaS / prompt-injection-as-first-class-threat / model-release cadence (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral, Nemotron).
