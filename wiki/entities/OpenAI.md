# OpenAI

AI research and deployment company. Originator of **ChatGPT** (Nov 2022) and the **GPT-3 / GPT-4 / GPT-5** series. Self-described in [[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation|the Bain/OpenAI HBR article]] as "an AI provider to over one million businesses."

## Governance trajectory

Originally founded (2015) as a **nonprofit foundation**. **Two or three "OpenAI crises" ago** ([[2026-05-10-ries-lennys-force-destroys-companies-within|Ries 2026]], 1:12:28), Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI to spin out [[Anthropic]] — the moment Ries dates as his own entry into the AI-governance-advice arc. Mid-2025, OpenAI **converted from the nonprofit-foundation governance to Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) structure** (Ries: *"although now they've converted to a public benefit corp structure"*).

Per Ries' framework, **PBC alone** is structurally weaker than the **PBC + Long-Term Benefit Trust** structure adopted by Anthropic — a PBC replaces the *any-lawful-act-or-purpose* clause with a specific declared purpose (making mission-pursuit a fiduciary obligation of the board) but lacks an *outside trustee body* holding the for-profit board accountable to that mission. The implication Ries does not state outright but the structural comparison implies: OpenAI's *original* nonprofit-foundation guardian was **stronger** than the eventual PBC-only structure; the 2025 conversion is a **governance downgrade** by Ries' criteria.

Ries describes the OpenAI history as *"a really hard case study to learn from because it's such a bizarre story and has involves like mega personalities like Elon and Sam like dueling to the death."* The deeper case-study narrative is deferred to *Incorruptible* (book, out 26 May 2026), not given on-air.

## Models referenced in this wiki

- **GPT-3** — substrate of the customer-support augmentation system in [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-li-raymond-generative-ai-at-work|Brynjolfsson, Li & Raymond (2025) QJE]].
- **GPT-3.5 / ChatGPT** — the democratization breakthrough cited by [[2026-04-28-anand-wu-genai-playbook|Anand-Wu]] and the trigger for the [[generative-ai|GenAI]] adoption wave.
- **GPT-4** — basis of the [[2026-04-28-dellacqua-jagged-technological-frontier|Dell'Acqua et al. 2026 BCG RCT]] and the [[2026-04-29-boussioux-crowdless-future|Boussioux et al. 2024 crowdless-future study]].
- **GPT-5** — used by [[2026-02-11-lopopolo-codex-harness-engineering|Lopopolo's Codex team]] (Feb 2026) to generate the initial repository scaffold via Codex CLI.

## Products and tooling referenced in this wiki

- **Codex** — agent-driven software engineering platform documented in [[2026-02-11-lopopolo-codex-harness-engineering|Lopopolo 2026]]. Five months of internal use produced ~1M LOC and ~1,500 PRs across an internal product, with **0 lines of manually-written code** and throughput averaging 3.5 PRs / engineer / day across 7 engineers (increasing with team size).
- **Codex CLI** — command-line interface for Codex; used (with GPT-5) to generate the initial repository scaffold for Lopopolo's project. The wiki's first concrete operational reference to Codex CLI tooling.
- **Aardvark** — second agent operating on the same Codex-team codebase, named in passing in [[2026-02-11-lopopolo-codex-harness-engineering|Lopopolo 2026]] as a beneficiary of repository legibility investments. Not detailed.
- **Sora** — text-to-video model + social-network app. Surfaces in [[2025-12-01-marily-nika-pms-who-use-ai-will-replace-those-who-dont|Nika 2025]] as the parallel demo to Google Flow / Veo for PM-side promo videos, with the **Cameo** feature (custom-instruction-shipped — *"always make me look good"*; reportedly Mark Cuban's cameo auto-injects a Cost Plus Drugs ad). Marily / Claire's tentative read: *"the social-network aspect of it is a distribution method for the underlying API models — power users find what's possible, then commercial applications follow."*
- **Custom GPTs** — user-authored, system-prompt-+-knowledge ChatGPT instances. [[2025-12-01-marily-nika-pms-who-use-ai-will-replace-those-who-dont|Nika 2025]] demonstrates a domain-specific custom GPT ("AI Product GPT") seeded with a PRD template and the author's voice, used as a structured prompt-input-to-prototype-tool pipeline component. Operationally a domain-specific *Context-layer artifact* in [[2026-05-07-chatterjee-anatomy-of-agent-harness|Chatterjee's]] vocabulary.

## Research initiatives appearing in this wiki

- **Economic Research team** (led by Chief Economist [[Aaron Chatterji]]). Counterpart to Anthropic's [[Anthropic Economic Index]] initiative. Members in this wiki: [[Gawesha Weeratunga]], [[Harrison Satcher]].
- **Lowe's partnership** ([[2026-05-02-dutt-chatterji-ai-experimentation-to-transformation]]): launched **Mylow** (online customer-facing) and **Mylow Companion** (in-store associate-facing) AI interfaces in March 2025; Mylow Companion deployed across 1,700+ Lowe's stores.

## Open questions

- The wiki has many references to GPT-4 / ChatGPT / OpenAI as substrate but no first-party OpenAI source has been ingested yet. The OpenAI Economic Research team's writing (this article, plus their independent research papers) is a candidate for a deeper deep-read once a primary OpenAI Economic Research publication is added.
