# Anthropic Economic Index

A research initiative by [[Anthropic]] that measures real-world AI use through privacy-preserving analysis of [[Claude]] conversations on Claude.ai (consumer) and the 1P API (enterprise). Recurring report cadence — five reports through March 2026.

Stated mission (per Anthropic): provide ongoing, empirical measurement of how AI is changing tasks, occupations, and the labor market.

## What it tracks

| Domain | Mapped to wiki concept |
|---|---|
| Task speedup, success, complexity | [[generative-ai]] |
| Automation vs. augmentation share | [[automation-vs-augmentation]] |
| Aggregate productivity impact | [[ai-employment-effects]] |
| Task-composition shift | [[ai-deskilling]] |
| Cross-country adoption | [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] |
| Task-horizon time scaling | [[ai-benchmarks]] |

## Reports

| Report | Sample period | Status in this wiki |
|---|---|---|
| First | January 2025 | Not separately ingested; numbers cited |
| Second | (early 2025) | Not separately ingested |
| Third | August 2025 | Not separately ingested; numbers carried over |
| **Fourth** | November 2025 | [[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025\|Ingested]] — introduces "economic primitives" framework |
| **Fifth — *Learning curves*** | February 5–12, 2026 | [[2026-05-07-anthropic-economic-index-5-learning-curves\|Ingested]] — model selection matches task value; high-tenure users have ~3-4 pp higher success after controls; **skill-biased technological change** framing |

## Economic primitives (introduced in fourth report)

Five measurements per conversation, derived by Claude classifying its own conversation samples:

1. **Task complexity** — human time required without AI; whether multiple tasks were handled within one conversation.
2. **Human and AI skill level** — years of education needed to understand prompts and Claude's responses.
3. **Use case** — work / education / personal.
4. **AI autonomy** — degree of user delegation, from collaboration to fully directive.
5. **Task success** — Claude's own assessment of whether the task was completed.

See [[2026-04-28-anthropic-economic-index-q4-2025|the fourth-report source page]] for definitions and applications.

## Methodology notes

- **Privacy-preserving** — random samples (typically 1M conversations on Claude.ai + 1M API transcripts).
- **Tasks mapped to O*NET** taxonomy. **O*NET vintage shifted** between the 4th and 5th reports (4th used 2010 vintage; 5th uses 2019). Year-over-year comparisons of task-share need this caveat.
- **Models change report-to-report** — fourth report uses [[Claude Sonnet 4.5]] predominantly; the fifth uses Claude Opus 4.5 / 4.6 in addition. This affects comparability across editions.

## Cited by external research

- [[2026-04-28-brynjolfsson-canaries-coal-mine|Brynjolfsson et al. 2025 (Canaries)]] uses the Anthropic Economic Index automation/augmentation classification at the occupation level for Fact 3.

## Open questions

- Earlier reports (1st through 3rd) are referenced indirectly through the fourth-report carry-over data; first-party ingestion of any prior report would clarify the longitudinal methodology.
