# Harvard Business Review

**Harvard Business Review** (HBR) is the management magazine published by Harvard Business Publishing, an affiliate of [[Harvard Business School]]. Founded 1922. Long-form articles aimed at executives and managers, blending academic research with practitioner perspectives.

A primary publishing venue for academic strategy and management work intended to reach C-suite readers.

**HBR IdeaCast (podcast / video):**

|---|---|---|---|---|
| [[2026-02-09-sternfels-mckinsey-survive-ai-and-reinvent-consulting\|How McKinsey Plans to Survive AI (and Reinvent Consulting)]] | Bob Sternfels (Global Managing Partner, [[McKinsey & Company]]) | Adi Ignatius (HBR editor-in-chief) | 9 Feb 2026 | McKinsey 100-yr reflection + AI strategy: 40k humans + 20k agents workforce, outcome-underwriting, post-controversy governance, hiring overhaul, four durable leadership skills |

**HBR.org Partner Content (sponsored / advertorial):**

Partner Content is a paid placement: a sponsor (named at the top of the article) authors the piece, HBR hosts it. Editorial standards differ from HBR editorial — no peer review, no Idea-in-Brief panel, no reprint code. Treat as **vendor-sponsored** per the [[../../CLAUDE.md#lifecycle|Lifecycle vendor-source rule]]: confidence boosts to any concept page cap at +0.05 and at 0.75 absolute when this is the sole supporting source.

| Article | Authors | Sponsor | Date | Topic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [[2026-02-09-ross-schneider-adaptability\|Resilience Won't Save Your Organization. Adaptability Will]] | [[Mike James Ross]], [[Greig Schneider]] | [[Egon Zehnder]] | 9 Feb 2026 | Leadership disposition + hiring criteria + personal practice for continuous-change adaptability; 1,200-CEO survey (92% agreement) |

HBR articles in the wiki use this convention: source `kind: article`. Print pieces include an `hbr_reprint` field; digital pieces use `journal_volume: "HBR.org Digital, <date>"`; partner-content pieces use `journal_volume: "HBR.org Partner Content, <date>"` and `section: "Partner Content from <sponsor>"`. **HBR IdeaCast** episodes use source `kind: video` (since the wiki currently ingests them via the video transcript pipeline) with `author: ["Harvard Business Review"]` per the [video source-page convention](../../CLAUDE.md#source-page-conventions-specific-to-videos).

## Article structure (recurring "Idea in Brief")

HBR articles open with a "Idea in Brief" panel: **The Problem / The Solution / The Payoff** (or variants like Problem / Why It Happens / The Solution). Useful when summarizing — the panel often distills the entire argument in 50–100 words.

## Cross-referenced HBR articles (not yet ingested)

The Anand-Wu article cites two earlier HBR pieces worth tracking:
- *"How Generative AI Can Augment Human Creativity"* (HBR Jul–Aug 2023) — relevant to [[generative-ai]] creative-catalyst quadrant.
- *"How Is Your Team Spending the Time Saved by Gen AI?"* (HBR Mar–Apr 2025) — relevant to [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] productivity-redeployment question.

## People affiliated with HBR

- **Adi Ignatius** — Editor-in-chief; long-time *IdeaCast* host. First wiki source mention by name in [[2026-02-09-sternfels-mckinsey-survive-ai-and-reinvent-consulting|Sternfels 2026]]. Per the [author-entity-promotion rule](../../CLAUDE.md#author-entity-promotion), do not promote on a single source — listed as Dangling. Promote on second-source mention.

## Open questions

- HBR's editorial process for AI-strategy articles (peer review? practitioner review?). Worth investigating once a third HBR source is ingested.
- Distinguishing HBR's flagship articles from HBR Press books and HBR.org "online" pieces — different rigor levels.
- *IdeaCast* curation: does the podcast surface narratives that contradict HBR's print articles, or is it always-aligned? The wiki has only one IdeaCast source so far.
